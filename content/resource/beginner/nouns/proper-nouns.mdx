title: Proper Nouns
description: A proper noun is a noun that refers to a unique thing
---

A proper noun is a noun that refers to a unique thing, such as (names, names of cities, planets, corporations etc.).

> **London** is the capital of **Great Britain**

Note that proper nouns are unique names. They are capitalized.

> **Olivia** wants to travel around **Europe** next year

We should also capitalize:

- Festivals

  > **Christmas** and **Thanksgiving** are my two favourite holidays!

- People's titles

  > Everything depends on **President** Trump and his decisions

- The names of books, films, plays, and paintings. We use capital letters for the nouns, adjectives, and verbs in the titles.

  > I've just finished reading '**The Old Man and the Sea**'

Sometimes we use a person's name to refer to something they have created.

> We were listening to **Mozart** the other day  
> I'm reading **an Iris Murdoch** now

When you use a word about a family member (e.g. mom, dad, uncle), capitalize it only if the word is being used exactly as you would use a name, i.e. if you were addressing the person directly. If the word is not being used as a name, it is not capitalized.

> Please ask **Dad** if he can buy wine on his way home  
> Is your **dad** coming over for dinner?

Whenever you see a capitalized word, question whether or not it is a proper noun. Make sure that the capitalized word is in fact a noun as there are also proper adjectives.

> **Asia** is one of the continents of the world <Asterisk label="(proper noun)" />  
> I don't really like **Asian** food <Asterisk label="(proper adjective)" />
