We use the past simple when we talk about an action which happened at a definite time in the past. This tense emphasizes that the action is finished. We can also use this tense to talk about how someone felt about something.

> When **was** your wedding?  
> It **was** 3 years ago. I **was** beyond happy to marry the love of my life

The past simple is formed by adding `-ed` to the bare infinitive of the regular verb. Regular verb ending in `-e` simply add `-d`. All persons have the same form.

> He **worked** part-time as a waiter  
> We **liked** our stay at the hotel

Regular verbs ending in _consonant_ + _-y_ change _-y_ to `-ie`.

- cry → _cried_
- try → _tried_

Regular verbs ending with _one vowel_ and _one consonant_ double the final consonant.

- stop → _stopped_
- regret → _regretted_

Irregular verbs are not formed the following the same pattern. Use the past tense form of the irregular verb. You can find the list of irregular verbs online.

- be → _was/were_
- eat → _ate_
- drink → _drank_

Note that the past tense form of the verb _to be_ depends on the person of the subject.

|    Singular     |   Plural    |
| :-------------: | :---------: |
|     _I was_     |  _we were_  |
|   _you were_    | _you were_  |
| _he/she/it was_ | _they were_ |

Question are formed with `did` and the bare infinitive of the verb. Negatives are formed with `did not` and the bare infinitive of the verb. Questions and negatives with both regular and irregular verbs are formed this pattern. All persons are formed with `did`/`did not`.

> (+) His sister lived in Sutton, London  
> (-) His sister did not live in Sutton. She lived in Harrow  
> (?) Did his sister live in Sutton? / Where did his sister live London?

Some time markers can show when the action happened or emphasize the habitual character of the action (in this case, you can use the phrase `every day`). These time markers are `yesterday`, `last night`, `(not) long time ago`, `two years ago` etc.

> Shakespeare died in **1616**  
> Ryan did not go to work **yesterday**. He got sick  
> **When** did you move to Spain? - I moved there **not a long time ago**

Note that we use `did`/`did not` with the verb _to have_.

> I didn't have enough money to buy a new computer

But we don't use `did` with the verb _to be_ (_was_/_were_)

> Why **were** you so angry?  
> I **wasn't** angry. This **was** my usual self
