title: Future Simple
description: We use the will future when we want to talk generally about future beliefs, opinions, hopes and predictions
---

We can refer to the future by using `will`, `be going to` or by using _present tenses_. We use the will future when we want to talk generally about future beliefs, opinions, hopes and predictions.

> _I promised myself that once I start college I **will** do all my assignments on time_

The will future is formed with `the infinitive` without `to`. Questions are indicated by inverting the subject and `will`. Negatives are formed with `will not` (`wont't`).

> (+) Sam will probably move to Canada next year  
> (-) Sam won't move to Canada next year. He will move to the US  
> (?) Will Sam move to Canada next year? / Where will Sam move to?

Note that in speech and informal writing `will` is usually shortened to `'ll`.

> He'll move to the US

Some time markers can show when we expect something to happen (`tomorrow`, `next month`, `in a day` etc.) or how certain or uncertain we are about our predictions (`perhaps`, `probably`, `definitely`, `certainly` etc.).

> **Perhaps** it'll snow **tomorrow**  
> I'll **definitely** finish my essay **next month**

Note that such time markers as `probably`, `definitely`, `certainly` come after `will` but before `won't`.

> We'll **probably** do it tomorrow  
> We **probably** won't do it tomorrow

Some speakers use `shall` to refer to the future in formal situations with `I` and `we`. However this use is becoming very rare. Nowadays `shall` is used for suggestions only.

> **Shall I** go or **shall we** leave together?

## Guided Practice

<Sidenote mt={8}>
  Use _will_ + _V_ to make sentences in future simple. Form questions by inverting the subject and
  _will_. Form negatives with _will not_.
</Sidenote>

- They (not to go) to the bar tomorrow. <InfoTooltip label="will not go" />

- What (you/to do) next week? - I don't know. I (to meet up) probably with some friends. <InfoTooltip label="What will you do next week?, I will probably meet up with some friends" />

<Sidenote>Use contracted forms _'ll_ and _won't_.</Sidenote>

- I (to call) you later, OK? <InfoTooltip label="I'll call you later, OK?" />

- I (not to do) anything without your advice. <InfoTooltip label={`I won't do anything without your advice`} />

<Sidenote>Find time/probability markers.</Sidenote>

- He'll finish his book in a week or two. <InfoTooltip label="week or two"/>
- You probably won't listen to me but I'll try to explain it. <InfoTooltip label="probably" />

<Sidenote>Use _shall_ for suggestions.</Sidenote>

- (we/to go)? It's getting late. <InfoTooltip label="Shall we go?" />

## Short Story using Future Simple

-_Mike, what are your plans for tonight?_

-_I don't know really. **I'll probably play some video games after work**._

-_And **what will you do tomorrow**?_

-_Well, **I definitely won't go out with my friends tomorrow.**_

-_And **what will you do next week?**_

-_**I'll most certainly start learning another language.**_

-_Mike, how do you have an answer for everything?_

-_It's quite simple. I don't plan anything. **Things will happen on their own.**_

## Independent Practice

**Find time markers.**

1. Perhaps you'll make the right decision. Time will tell. <InfoTooltip label="perhaps" />

2. Max will certainly come later tonight. <InfoTooltip label="certainly, later tonight" />

3. Susan will try to go there next month but it probably won't happen. <InfoTooltip label="next month, probably" />

**Write the correct sentence.**

1. Why can't you come over? I (to let) you sleep at my place <InfoTooltip label="I'll let you sleep at my place" />

2. I (not to do) it unless you prove Jane wrong. <InfoTooltip label="I won't do it unless you prove Jane wrong" />

3. We (to try) to make it work. We (to let) you know. <InfoTooltip label="We'll try to make it work. We'll let you know" />

4. (we/to go) to the restaurant tonight? I (to pay) for the meal. <InfoTooltip label="Shall we go to the restaurant tonight? I'll pay for the meal" />

**Answer the questions.**

1. What will you do tomorrow? <InfoTooltip label="I'll probably stay at home and sleep the whole day" />

2. Where will you stay during your summer vacation? <InfoTooltip label="I'll stay at my friends' place" />

3. Will robots take over the planet? <InfoTooltip label="Robots won't take over the planet. / I don't think that robots will take over the planet." />
