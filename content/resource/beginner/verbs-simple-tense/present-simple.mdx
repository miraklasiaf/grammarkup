title: Present Simple
description: We use the present simple when we talk about things in general
---

We use the present simple when we talk about things in general. We use this tense to say that something:

- happens all the time
- happens repeatedly
- is true in general

Have a look at the example below.

> Jane **works** as a barista. Her shift **begins** at 7 a.m

In the first sentence is general truth. And the second sentence is something that happens repeatedly all the time.

The present simple is formed with the bare infinitive form of the verb. We add `-s` in the third person singular (_he/she/it_).

> I **like** apples but my father **likes** grapes

Verbs ending in `o`, `s`, `ch`, `sh`, `x` add `-es` for the third person singular.

> My sister **watches** TV in the evening and my brother **does** his homework

Such verbs as `to be` and `to have` are irregular.

|     To Be      |            |     To Have     |             |
| :------------: | :--------: | :-------------: | :---------: |
|     _I am_     |  _we are_  |    _I have_     |  _we have_  |
|   _you are_    | _you are_  |   _you have_    | _you have_  |
| _he/she/it is_ | _they are_ | _he/she/it has_ | _they have_ |

Note the difference between British English and American English.

> (BrE) I have got a car. (Present Perfect)  
> (AmE) I have a car. (Present Simple)

Questions are formed with `do` and the bare infinitive form of the verb. The third person singular is formed with `does`.

Negatives are formed with `do not` and the bare infinitive form of the verb. The third person singular is formed with `does not` and the bare infinitive form of verb.

> (+) He gets up at 6 o'clock every morning  
> (-) He does not get up at 6 o'clock every morning. He gets up at 7  
> (?) Does he get up at 6 o'clock every morning? / When does he get up?

Some time markers can explain how often someone does an action, or something happens. These time markers are `always`, `often`, `usually`, `sometimes`, `rarely`, `never`, `every day` etc.

> I **usually cook** at home but my friend **always** eats at the local cafe

Note that in the above examples time markers come before the verb. With the verb `to be` the time marker comes after it.

> Kim is **always** late for classes
