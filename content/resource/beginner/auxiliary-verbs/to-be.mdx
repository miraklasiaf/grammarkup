title: To Be
description: To be is the most common verb in English. It can be used as an auxiliary and a main verb
---

We use auxiliary verbs to form questions, negative sentences, compound tenses (the perfect tense or the continuous tense), or the passive voice. Auxiliary verbs are also known as _helping verbs_. They are used together with a main verb to give grammatical information and additional meaning to a sentence.

Although there are 23 helping verbs in English, which include modal verbs (can, must etc.), the basic auxiliary verbs are `to be`, `to do`, and `to have`.

`To be` is the most common verb in English. It can be used as an auxiliary and a main verb.

> My sister **is** kind (main verb)  
> My sister **is cooking** dinner (auxiliary verb; helps to build the present continuous tense)

Note that the verb `to be` is irregular.

|           Form            |   Verb    |
| :-----------------------: | :-------: |
|           Base            |    be     |
|          Present          | am/is/are |
|           Past            | was/were  |
| Present Participle/Gerund |   being   |
|      Past Participle      |   been    |

You can use the auxiliary verb `to be`:

- **when you don't want to repeat something**

> Everyone was working that day, but I **wasn't**. (=I wasn't working.)

- **to deny something or say that it is not true**

> You're being unreasonable. - No, **I'm not.** (=I'm not being unreasonable.)

- **to show interest in what somebody has said, or to show surprise**

> Kelly and Peter are dating. - **Are they?** Really?

- **with so (when you agree) and neither/nor (when you disagree)**. In this case, an auxiliary verb goes before the subject.

> I'm sleepy. - **So am I**. (=I'm sleepy too.)  
> My parents are never late. - **Neither are mine.** (=My parents are never late either.)
