Demonstratives are words that show which person or thing is being referred to.

> **This** is Hugh, and **that** is Kevin

Demonstratives show where an object, event, or person is in relation to the speaker. They can refer to a physical or a psychological closeness or distance.

|                                                   | Near the speaker | Far from the speaker |
| :------------------------------------------------ | :--------------: | :------------------: |
| Adverbs                                           |      _here_      |       _there_        |
| Demonstrative with singular and uncountable nouns |      _this_      |        _that_        |
| Demonstrative with plural countable nouns         |     _these_      |       _those_        |

Demonstratives can be placed before the noun or the adjective that modifies the noun.

> **That old man** stole my purse!  
> **These oranges** are delicious!

Demonstratives can also appear before a number by itself when the noun is understood from the context.

> I'll take **this one**, please. = I'll take this watermelon, please

Demonstratives can be used by themselves when the noun they modify is understood from the context.

> **Those** aren't yours. Put them back. = Those shoes aren't yours. Put them back

When talking about events, the near demonstratives are often used to refer to the present while the far demonstratives often refer to the past.

> **This situation** is quite unstable  
> **That event** made me realise how important my family is to me
