Distributives determiners or simply distributives refer to a group of people or things, and to individual members of the group. They show different ways of looking at the individuals within a group, and they express how something is distributed, shared, or divided.

> **All people** want to love and to be loved

## Distributive All

The distributive determiner `all` is used to talk about a whole group, with a special emphasis on the fact that nothing has been left out.

`All` can be used with uncountable nouns and plural countable nouns by itself. In this usage, it refers to the group as a concept rather than as individuals.

> **All parents** want the best for their children

`All` can be used with uncountable nouns and plural countable nouns preceded by `the` or a possesive adjective. In these uses, the word `of` can be added just after `all` with no change in meaning.

> Have you eaten **all the cookies** in the jar? = Have you eaten **all of the cookies** in the jar?

`All` can be used with plural pronouns preceded by `of`.

> **All of us** are going to be there tonight

`All` can be used in questions and exclamations with uncountable nouns preceded by `this`/`that` or with countable nouns preceded by `these`/`those`. In these uses, the word `of` can be added just after `all` with no change in meaning.

> Look at **all this snow** out there!  
> What are **all these people** doing in our house?

## Distributive Half

The distributive determiner `half` is used to talk about a whole group divided in two. `Half` can be used as a distributive in several different patterns.

`Half` can refer to measurements if it is followed by an indefinite article `a`/`an` and a noun.

> I'll be back in **half an hour**

`Half` can be used with plural pronouns preceded by `of`.

> Only **half of us** are going to be there tonight

`Half` can be used with nouns preceded by `the`, `a`/`an`, a demonstratives, or a possesive adjective. In this case, the meaning refers to a concrete, physical division. The word `of` can be added just after `half` with no change in meaning.

> **Half the people** have already left the party  
> Putting **half a kilo of sugar** into the topping will ruin the cake  
> I want **half of that cake**!  
> Sorry, but I used **half of your eggs** making breakfast today
