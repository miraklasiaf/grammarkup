Articles are words that define a noun as specific or unspecific. English has two types of articles:

- **indefinite**: _a/an_
- **definite**: _the_

> I'am **a** nurse. **The** hospital I'm working in is huge

The indefinite article takes two forms - `a`/`an`. Use the indefinite article `a` when it precedes a word that begins with a consonant. Use the indefinite article `an` when it precedes a word that begins with a vowel. For example:

- a table
- an umbrella
- a university
- an honest person

The indefinite article `a` indicates that a noun refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing.

> What does **a** fox say?

We use `a`/`an` when the listener does not know which person or thing we are talking about.

> Helen's brother works in **a** factory. I don't know which factory exactly

If we refer to something for the first time, it will be new information for the listener so we use `a`/`an`. When referencing to the same thing again use `the` because now the listener knows what we are talking about.

> I bought **a** new computer. It's really great! **The** computer is much better than my previous one

The definite article is the word `the`. It limits the meaning of a noun to one particular thing. We use `the` when it is clear which thing or person we are talking about.

> **The** cake is in the fridge. I know that Kate made it

We use the definite article `the` with:

- **nationalities and other groups** -- the French, the Italians, the old, the poor
- **time** -- in the past, in the future (but at present)
- **superlatives** -- You are the first one!
- **musical instruments** -- I played the piano as a kid
- **countries which are group or plural** -- the U.S., the U.K., the United Arab Emirates, the Netherlands
- **names of ships** -- We sailed on the Claudia
- **oceans** -- the Pacific, the Atlantic
- **rivers** -- the Amazon, the Nile

**Note**: we use zero article with plurals and uncountable nouns when we are generally talking about something.

> **Dogs** are not allowed in that shop <Asterisk label="We are talking about dogs in general" />  
> **The dogs** next door were barking at night <Asterisk label="We are talking about the particular dogs" />
