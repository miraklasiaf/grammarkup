title: Subject Pronouns
description: A subject pronoun is a pronoun that takes the place of a noun as the subject of a sentence
---

A subject is **the person or thing that performs the action** in the clause or sentence. A subject pronoun is a pronoun that takes the place of a noun as the subject of a sentence.

> **She** told me about her worries

Subject pronouns replace nouns that are the subject of their clause. Look the following table.

|            |  Singular   | Plural |
| :--------: | :---------: | :----: |
| 1st person |     _I_     |  _we_  |
| 2nd person |    _you_    | _you_  |
| 3rd person | _he/she/it_ | _they_ |

We should replace the subject with a subject pronoun to avoid repetition.

> ~~Mary is a student and Mary is very hard working~~. Mary is a student and she is very hard working

We use the subject pronoun `it` when we refer to objects, things, animals, or ideas.

> Love is eternal. **It** will last forever

Sometimes when we don't know the sex of a baby, we can use `it`.

> Their baby is so small. **it** only weights 2 kilos

We use _it_ when we talk about time, weather, or temperature.

> What time is it? - **It's** 7 o'clock. It's quite cold today
