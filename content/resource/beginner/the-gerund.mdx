The gerund looks exactly the same as the present participle but the gerund always has the same function as a noun (although it looks like a verb).

> **Cooking at home** can help you save a lot of money

The gerund is a noun made from a verb by adding `-ing`.

Verbs ending in `-e` drop -e and add `-ing`.

> make → _making_  
> write → _writing_

Verbs with one syllable, ending in one vowel and one consonant, double the consonant and add `-ing`.

> knit → _knitting_  
> swim → _swimming_

Verbs ending `-ie` change -ie to `-y` and add `-ing`.

> lie → _lying_  
> die → _dying_

The gerund can be made negative by adding not.

> The best thing for your health is not smoking

The gerund can function as:

- **the subject of the sentence**

> **Smoking** causes lung cancer  
> **Flying** makes him anxious

- **the complement of the verb _to be_**

> One of her duties was **writing weekly reports**  
> The hardest thing about learning Russian is **memorizing the verbs of movement**

The gerund can be used:

- **after prepositions or as part of certain expressions** (_there's no point in, in spite of etc_.)

> Can your brother count to ten **without looking** at his fingers?  
> **There's no point in** going back to his place now

- **after phrasal verbs**. They are composed of `a verb` + `preposition`/`adverb`

> I **ended up buying** a new computer  
> Rachel **gave up drinking** sugar drinks
