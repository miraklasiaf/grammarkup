---

Adverbs of time tell us when an action happened, for how long, or how often. Adverbs of time are invariable.

> Sorry, I'll call you **in a minute**

Adverbs of time are usually placed at the end of the sentence.

> I'll do it **tomorrow**

Sometimes these adverbs can be put at the beginning of the sentence to give a different emphasis.

> **Later** they noticed his absence

In the adverbial phrases that tell us for how long something has been happening, `for` is always followed by an expression of duration, while `since` is always followed by an expression of a point in time.

> They'll be away **for twenty days**  
> I haven't seen you **since June**!

Adverbs that tell us how often something happens express the frequency of an action. They are usually placed before the main verb but after auxiliary verbs (such as `to have`, `may`, `must`).

> Sarah **usually** wakes up at **7 a.m.**  
> You must **always** be kind to others.

The only exception is when the main verb is `to be`, in which case the adverb goes after the main verb.

> I am **never** late

If you need to use more than one adverb of time in a sentence, use them in the following order:

1. how long
2. how often
3. when

> Peter worked at the mall for **4 days every week last year**

## Guided Practice

<Sidenote mt={8}>
  Use adverbs of time to show when an action happened or for how long it has been happening. Place
  these adverbs at the end of the sentence.
</Sidenote>

- `Why` · `yesterday` · `you` · `to be absent`. <InfoTooltip label="Why were you absent yesterday?" />

<Sidenote>
  Sometimes adverbs of time can be put at the beginning of the sentence to give a different
  emphasis.
</Sidenote>

- `James` · `to realise` · `soon` · `that he` · `to make a mistake`. <InfoTooltip label="Soon James realised that he made a mistake" />

<Sidenote>
  The adverbial phrases that tell us for how long something has been happening, _for_ is always
  followed by an expression of duration, while _since_ is always followed by an expression of a
  point in time.
</Sidenote>

- I've been waiting for you <Blank /> an hour! <InfoTooltip label="I've been waiting for you for an hour!" />

- Bill has been trying to find a job <Blank /> May! <InfoTooltip label="Bill has been trying to find a job since May!" />

<Sidenote>
  Place adverbs that tell us how often something happens before the main verb but after auxiliary
  verbs. If there is a verb _to be_, then the adverb goes after the main verb.
</Sidenote>

- `We` · `to buy` · `groceries` · `often` · `together`. <InfoTooltip label="We often buy groceries together." />

- `He` · `to be late` · `usually` · `for classes`. <InfoTooltip label="He is usually late for classes." />

<Sidenote>
  If you need to use more than one adverb of time in a sentence, use them in the following order:
  how long, how often, and when.
</Sidenote>

- (`Lily` · `to study` · `every day` · `for 5 hours` · `a month ago`). She had a difficulty exam at university. <InfoTooltip label="Lily studied for 5 hours every day a month ago." />
