title: How to Form Adverbs
description: An adverb is a word or set of words that modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs
---

An adverb is a word or set of words that modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Usually adverbs modify verbs, telling us how, how often, when, or where something was done.

> We walked **really slowly**

In most cases, an adverb is formed by adding `-ly` to an adjective.

> slow → _slowly_

Adverbs formed from adjectives ending in `-l` have double l.

> careful → _carefully_

if the adjective ends in `-able`, `-ible`, or `-le`, replace the `-e` with `-y`.

> probable → _probably_  
> terrible → _terribly_  
> gentle → _gently_

if the adjective ends in `ic`, add `-ally`. There is an exception: public - publicly.

> economic → _economically_

Adjectives that end in `-ly`, such as `friendly` or `lively`, can't be made into adverbs by adding `-ly`. We can use `in a friendly way/manner` instead.

> He talked to me **in a friendly manner**

The following adverbs have the same form as the adjectives: `early`, `fast`, `hard`, `high`, `late`, `near`, `straight`, `wrong`.

> The train is very **fast** (adjective)  
> The train goes **fast** (adverb)

Note that the adverb `well` corresponds to the adjective `good`.

> Tom is a **good** student. He studies **well**

Note that the adverb `hardly` is not related to the meaning of hard. The adverb `hardly` has the meaning `almost not`.

> **Hardly** anyone writes to me these days (=Almost no one writes to me these days.)  
> Susan ate **hardly** anything (=Susan ate almost nothing.)

## Guided Practice

<Sidenote mt={8}>
  An adverb is formed by adding _-ly_ to an adjective. adjectives ending in _-l_ have double _l_. if
  the adjective ends in _-able_, _-ible_, or _-le_, replace the -e with -y. if the adjective ends in
  _ic_, add _-ally_. There is an exception: public - publicly

  Adjectives ending in _-ly_, such as _friendly_ or _lively_, can't be made into adverbs by adding
  _-ly_. Use `in a friendly way/manner` instead.
