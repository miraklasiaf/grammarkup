Coordinating conjunctions are used to link words, phrases, and clauses of equal importance in a sentence.

> Sam complains about his job, **yet** he doesn't try to find a new one

There are seven coordinating conjunctions - `for`, `and`, `nor`, `but`, `or`, `yet`, `so`.

> They couldn't afford to rent the apartment, **for** it was too expensive  
> You can't have your cake **and** eat it  
> Samantha doesn't want to go out, **nor** does she invite us to her place  
> I was quite anxious at the beginning, **but** eventually I managed to pull myself together  
> You can call me **or** send a message when you get off from work  
> Ben says that he is busy all the time, **yet** he has time to play online games every day  
> Bill is allergic to dairy, **so** he doesn't eat any cheese
