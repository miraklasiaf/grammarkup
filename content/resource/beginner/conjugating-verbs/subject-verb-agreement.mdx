The subject-verb agreement is the correspondence of a verb with its subject in person (first, second, or third) and number (singular or plural).

> **Liz** is an accountant and **she has** a typical 8-5 job

The verb `is` corresponds with the subject Liz which is in the first person and singular. And the verb `has` corresponds with the pronoun `she` which is in the third person and singular.

Subject and verbs must agree with one another in person (first, second, or third). Note the subject-verb agreement rules of the verb `to be` in present tenses.

|            |    Singular    |   Plural   |
| :--------: | :------------: | :--------: |
| 1st person |     _I am_     |  _we are_  |
| 2nd person |   _you are_    | _you are_  |
| 3rd person | _he/she/it is_ | _they are_ |

> **I am** a student (1st person), **my brother is** a pupil (3rd person), and **you are** a teacher (2nd person)

Subject and verbs must agree with one another in number (singular or plural). Thus, if a subject is singular, its verb must also be singular, if a subject is plural, its verb must also be plural.

> **She cooks** dinner, and **her brothers make** breakfast

When the subject of the sentence is composed of two or more nouns or pronouns connected by the conjunction `and`, use a plural verb.

> **Brothers and sisters don't** often **get along**

The words `each`, `each one`, `either`, `neither`, `everyone`, `everybody`, `anyone`, `anybody`, `nobody`, `somebody`, `someone`, and `no one` are singular and require a singular verb.

> **Each of these suggestions is** interesting  
> **Someone was standing** at the door

When two or more singular nouns or pronouns are connected by `or` or `nor`, use a singular verb.

> **Either your mother or dad needs** to contact me

When a compound subject contains both a singular and a plural noun or pronoun joined by `or` or `nor`, the verb should agree with the part of the subject that is closer to the verb (also called _the rule of proximity_).

> The teacher or **the students write** homework on the board  
> The students or **the teacher writes** homework on the board

In sentences beginning with `there is` or `there are`, the subject follows the verb (also called _the inverted object_). As `there is` not the subject, the verb agrees with what follows.

> There **is a book** on the table  
> There **are books** on the table

The subject-verb agreement with words that indicate portions (e.g. `a lot`, `a majority`, `some`, `all`): if the noun after `of` is singular, use a singular verb; if it is plural, use a plural verb.

> **There is a lot of fuss** around his arrival  
> **There are a lot of people** in the room

Use a singular verb with distances, periods of time, sums of money, etc., when considered as a unit.

> **Ten dollars is** a high price to pay for socks  
> **Ten dollars** (i.e dollar bills) **were** scattered on the floor

Collective nouns are words that imply more than one person but are considered singular and take a singular verb (e.g family, group, team, committee, class, etc.).

> **My family is** very big

## Short Story using Subject-Verb Agreement

-_There are a lot of people outside. Do you know what's going on?_

-_But I didn't see any media around._

-_I'm sure that some reporters will come in a bit. It's not like there are a couple of people so it's difficult to ignore this._
