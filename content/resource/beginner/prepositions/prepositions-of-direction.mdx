Prepositions of direction are used to show movement from one place to the other. We usually use prepositions of direction when we answer the question beginning with "Where?".

> **Where** are you going? - I'm going **to** the supermarket

There are several commonly used prepositions of direction:

- **to** -- used to show movement in a specific direction.

> I'll head off **to** work in a couple of minutes  
> Kimberly moved **to** Florida a year ago

Note that you can also used `towards` in the meaning "in the direction of".

> Why are these policemen running **towards** Erick?

- **into** -- used to show movement into something (enclosed space), while **onto** shows movement on top of something (surface).

> The dog jumped **into** kennel, while the cat leaped **onto** the roof of the kennel

- **across** -- used to show movement from one side to the other side of something.

> You can't walk **across** the street wherever you want

- **over** -- used to show an upward and forward direction across something.

> The boys jumped **over** the fence and chased the cat

- **through** -- used to show an movement within an enclosed space from one point to the other.

> I don't like driving **through** the tunnels. I feel a bit anxious then

- **past** -- used to indicate movement near something while you are on your way to another location.

> I waved at Mary but she walked **past** me
