Prepositions of place are used to show the position or location of one thing with another. We usually use prepositions of place when we answer the question beginning with "Where?".

> **Where** do you live? - I live **in** New York

There are three main prepositions of place:

- **at** -- denotes specific point or location of something.

> There's someone standing **at** the door (specific location)  
> There weren't many people **at** the theatre. It's Monday after all (specific location)  
> Alex lives at number 25 Emerald Street (address)  
> Ashley works **at** Apple (company or workplace)

- **in** -- implies that something is located in an enclosed space or within a larger area.

> I think I left my phone **in** the living-room (the living-room is part of your house)  
> Jake lives **in** the U.S. He lives **in** Texas (country, state etc.)

- **on** -- implies that something is located on the surface.

> Could you grab my phone? It's on the coffee table in the living-room (the surface of furniture.)  
> Jake's sister is **on** the west coast. She absolutely loves the Pacific!\_ (position along a road, river or by the sea, lake etc.)  
> Alex lives **on** the 3rd floor (the floor in the building)  
> Sorry, I'll call you back. I'm **on** the train now (public transport)  
> My grandparents work **on** a farm (open fields = the surface of the earth)

Sometimes you can use both `at` and `in` when you talk about the location, although there is a slight difference in meaning. Study the following examples:

> My siblings are **at** the mall now (You are stating the location in general. Your sibilngs could be inside the mall, somewhere at the entrance, or at the parking lot.)  
> My siblings are **in** the mall now (You are specifying that your siblings are inside the mall building.)

## Guided Practice

<Sidenote mt={8}>
  Use prepositions of place when you answer the question beginning with "Where?".
</Sidenote>

- Where do you live? - I live <Blank /> Paris. But right now, I'm living <Blank /> Madrid for a couple of weeks. <InfoTooltip label="I live in Paris. But right now I'm living in Madrid for a couple of weeks." />

<Sidenote>
  Use _at_ to denote specific point or location of something. Use _in_ when something is located in
  an enclosed space or within a larger area.
</Sidenote>

- As you know, my sister Mary works <Blank /> Apple. She really likes it there as she doesn't work <Blank /> a tiny cubicle but <Blank /> an open space office instead. Mary says it boosts her creativity. <InfoTooltip label="As you know, my sister Mary works at Apple. She really likes it there as she doesn't work in a tiny cubicle but in an open space office instead." />

<Sidenote>
  Use _in_ when something is located in an enclosed space or within a larger area. Use _on_ when
  something is located on the surface.
</Sidenote>

- I can't believe there is so much storage space <Blank /> the closet. And look at these cute pillows <Blank /> the bed. And there are even flowers <Blank /> the vase <Blank /> the windowsill. This room is just lovely! <InfoTooltip label="I can't believe there is so much storage space in the closet. And look at these cute pillows on the bed.
