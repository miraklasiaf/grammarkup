Abstract nouns refer to intangible things, like actions, feelings, ideals, concepts, and qualities.

Abstract nouns fall into several categories:

- **emotions and feelings** -- anger, sadness, love, grief etc.

- **human qualities and characteristics** -- beauty, maturity, humour, patience etc.

- **ideas and concepts** -- knowledge, freedom, luxury, comfort etc.

- **events** -- Marriage, birthday, career, adventure etc.

Many abstract nouns are formed from adjectives, verbs, or nouns. Sometimes you can add a
suffix to the concrete noun or alter the word root to form abstract nouns.

> child (concrete noun), child**hood** (abstract noun)

Nouns with the following suffixes are often abstract:

|                                  |                               |                               |
| :------------------------------: | :---------------------------: | :---------------------------: |
|    `-tion` <br /> _devotion_     |   `-ism` <br /> _pessimism_   |  `-ity` <br /> _hospitality_  |
|    `-ment` <br /> _movement_     | `-ness`<br /> _restlessness_  |   `-age` <br /> _marriage_    |
