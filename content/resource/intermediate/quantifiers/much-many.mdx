---

We use `much` with uncountable nouns and `many` with countable nouns. Note that much and many are mainly used in interrogative and negative sentences.

> How **many** cousins do you have? (countable)  
> How **much** money did you spend? (uncountable)

Note that `how much` can also be used when we want to know the price of something. In this case, we can use `how much` with countable nouns (both singular and plural nouns).

> How **much** does this dress cost?

`Much` and `many` can be used in affirmative sentences in combination with `too` and `so`. In this case, they denote the excessive amount of something.

> I donâ€™t know what to do with **so much sugar**!  
> There are **too many people** in here.
