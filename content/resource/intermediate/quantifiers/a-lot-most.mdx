In spoken English and informal writing when we want to indicate a large quality of something we tend to use `a lot`, `a lot of`, `lots of`.

`A lot` means very often or very much. It is used as an adverb. It often comes at the end of a sentence and never before a noun.

> My brother plays football **a lot**  
> She's **a lot** happier after quitting her job

`A lot of` is more formal than `lots of`. They both mean a large amount or number of poeple or things and they can be used with plural countable nouns and with singular uncountable nouns for affirmatives, negatives, and questions.

> That's **a lot of money**  
> There are **a lot of great students** here  
> Weve got **lots of** things to do today

We use the quantifier `most` to talk about quantities, amounts and degree. We can use it with a noun (as a determiner) or without a noun (as a pronoun). We can also use it with adjectives and adverbs to form the superlative.

We use `most` with nouns in the meaning the majority of. If there is no article, demonstrative or possessive pronoun, we use `most` right before the noun.

> **Most tap water** is drinkable.

When we are talking about the majority of a specific set of something, we use `most of the` + `noun`.

> **Most cakes** are sweet (cakes in general)  
> The party was amazing. Kate made **most of the cakes** herself (a specific set of cakes at the party)

We can leave out the noun with `most` when the noun is obvious from the context.

> Students can eat in the cafeteria but **most** bring food from home (=most students)
