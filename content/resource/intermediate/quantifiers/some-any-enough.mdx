We use `some` and `any` when we are talking about limited but rather indefinite number or quantities.

In general, we use `some` for affirmative sentences, and `any` for negatives and questions. Both can be used with countable and uncountable nouns.

> Jane bought **some** flowers  
> Did Jane buy **any** flowers? - No, she didn't buy **any**

`Some` can be used for questions, typically offers and requests, if we think the answer will be positive.

> Would you like **some** tea?

`Any` can be used in the meaning "it doesn't matter which".

> You can take **any** bus. They all go to the centre (=it doesn't matter which bus you take.)

We use `enough` to indicate sufficiency, while in negative sentences it means less than sufficient or less than necessary.

> I'll take your t-shirt. It's **big enough** to fit me  
> Sorry, but I can't go with you. I don't have **enough money** for that
