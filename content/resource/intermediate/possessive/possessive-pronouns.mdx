---

A pronoun is a word that replaces a noun in a sentence, making the subject a person or a thing. Possessive pronouns are pronouns that demonstrate ownership.

> This car is **mine**

Possessive pronouns are used instead of a possessive adjective and noun. Study the following table:

| Subject | Object | Possesive Adjective | Possesive Pronoun |
| :-----: | :----: | :-----------------: | :---------------: |
|   _I_   |  _me_  |        _my_         |      _mine_       |
|  _you_  | _you_  |       _your_        |      _yours_      |
|  _he_   | _him_  |        _his_        |       _his_       |
|  _she_  | _her_  |        _her_        |      _hers_       |
|  _it_   |  _it_  |        _its_        |       _its_       |
|  _we_   |  _us_  |        _our_        |      _ours_       |
| _they_  | _them_ |       _their_       |     _theirs_      |

Note that there is no apostrophe in possessive pronouns ending in -s.

> I don’t remember buying these jeans. I think they are **yours**

Possessive pronouns stand on their own. They are not used with another noun.

> This is **her cat** (possessive adjective + noun)  
> This cat is **hers** (possessive pronoun)

We can use possessive pronouns after `of`.

> Jake is one of my friends. = Jake is **a friend of mine**

Possessive pronouns simplify constructions that show possession of a noun.

> This is your room and that is our room. → This is your room and that is **ours**
