---

The possessive form is used with nouns referring to people, groups of people, countries, and animals. It shows a relationship of belonging between one thing and another.

> **Leslie’s** aunt is a doctor

To form the possessive, add an apostrophe + `-s` to the noun.

> **My brother’s** computer was stolen a week ago  
> **Children’s** toys were on the ground

If the noun already ends in -s , just add an apostrophe.

> **Students’** homework will be assessed later

For names ending in -s , you can either add an apostrophe + -s , or just an apostrophe. The first option is more common.

> They want to sell **James’s** car

Study some of the fixed expressions where the possessive form is used.

> a day’s work, a month’s pay, in a year’s time, for God’s sake

Note that the possessive is also used to refer to shops, restaurants, churches, universities etc., using the name or job title of the owner.

> I want to go to **Luigi’s** for dinner
> Peter has an appointment at the **dentist’s** at 10 a.m
