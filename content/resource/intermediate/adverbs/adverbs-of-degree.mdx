Adverbs of degree tell us about the intensity of something. They are usually placed before the adjective, adverb, or verb that they modify.

> I was **too** scared to move forward

The most common adverbs of degree are `extremely`, `quite`, `just`, `almost`, `very`, `too`, `enough`, etc.

`Enough` can be used as both an adverb and as a determiner. `Enough` as an adverb meaning "to the necessary degree" goes after the adjective or adverb that it is modifying. It can be used both in positive and negative sentences.

> This bed isn't comfortable **enough**

`Enough` is often followed by _to_ + _infinitive_ or _for something_/_something_.

> They're not old **enough to get married**  
> This suit is big **enough for Mike**

The adverb `too` has two distinct meanings, each with its own usage patterns. `Too` as an adverb meaning "also" goes at the end of the phrase it modifies. `Too` as an adverb meaning "excessively" goes before the adjective or adverb it modifies. It can be used both in positive and negative sentences. `Too` is often followed by _to_ + _infinitive_ or _for something_/_something_.

> I'd like to go to the cinema **too**!  
> Is he **too young to become a president**? - No, he isn't **too young for that**

Note that there is a big difference in meaning between `too` and `very`. `Very` expresses a fact while `too` suggests that there is a problem.

> She speaks **very quickly**  
> She speaks **too quickly**. I can't understand her
