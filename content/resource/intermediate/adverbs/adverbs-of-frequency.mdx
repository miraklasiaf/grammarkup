Adverbs of frequency tell us how often something happens. They are also used to indicate routine or repeated activities.

> I **always** do my homework

These adverbs are usually placed before the main verb but after auxiliary verbs (such as `to have`, `may`, `must`).

> Our company **frequently** has brunches with potential clients  
> You should **always** wait for the green light to cross the road

The only exception is when the main verb is `to be`, in which case the adverb goes after the main verb.

> We are **usually** optimistic

Here are the most common adverbs of frequency:

| Frequency | Adverb of Frequency  | Example                                            |
| :-------- | :------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 100%      | _always_             | _She **always** helps her mom with dinner._        |
| 90%       | _usually_            | _We **usually** go out on Fridays._                |
| 80%       | _normally/generally_ | _Shaun **normally** eats breakfast at 8 a.m._      |
| 70%       | _often/frequently_   | _They **often** go to their parents at weekends._  |
| 50%       | _sometimes_          | _Peter **sometimes** forgets his kids` birthdays._ |
| 30%       | _occasionally_       | _I **occasionally** eat vegetarian food._          |
| 10%       | _seldom_             | _We **seldom** go on vacation together._           |
| 5%        | _hardly ever/rarely_ | _Meredith **hardly ever** drinks coffee._          |
| 0%        | _never_              | _They **never** eat junk food._                    |

We can also use the following expressions when we want to be more specific about frequency: `every day`, `once a month`, `twice a year`, `three times a day`, `every other week`, `daily`, `monthly`, `annually` etc.

> I usually eat pizza **once a month**

If you need to use more than one adverb of time in a sentence, use them in the following order: (1) _how long_, (2) _how often_, (3) _when_.

> Peter worked at the mall for **4 days <Asterisk label="how long" /> every week <Asterisk label="how often" /> last year <Asterisk label="when" />**
