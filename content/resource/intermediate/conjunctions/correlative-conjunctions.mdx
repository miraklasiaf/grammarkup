description: Correlative conjunctions connect two equal grammatical items in a sentence.
---

Correlative conjunctions connect two equal grammatical items in a sentence.

> **Either** you apologise **or** I'll call mommy!

These conjunctions come in pairs - `either ... or`, `neither ... nor`, `not only ... but also`, `rather ... than` etc.

When using correlative conjunctions, pay attention to the subject-predicate agreement so that you have parallel structures.

> ~~College life is not only about partying, but also study like crazy~~  
> College life is **not only** about partying, **but also** studying like crazy

Note that a negative correlative like `neither ... nor` can go at the beginning of a sentence. In this case, the word order is inverted, and the auxiliary verb comes before the subject. Compare the sentences:

> **Neither did** Sam clean the apartment **nor did** he buy groceries  
> Sam **neither cleaned** the apartment **nor bought** groceries
