title: Shall - Should
description: We use modal verbs to show if we believe something is certain, probable or possible (or not). We also use modals to ask permission, make requests and offers etc.
---

The modal verb `shall` is mostly used in formal speech and some legal documents. We use the modal verb `shall` and _the base form of the verb_ to form sentences. Questions are formed by inverting the subject and `shall`. Negatives are formed with _not_.

Nowadays, the most common use of `shall` in everyday English is in questions that serve as offers or suggestions (Shall I? Shall we?).

> **Shall** I order some pizza?  
> **Shall we** go now? It's getting late

We can use the modal verb `should`:

- **to give advice, a recommendation, or a suggestion**.

> I think you **should** study more

- **to express that situation is likely in the present or in the future (a prediction).**

> Kelly **should** be at home by now. You can stop by  
> I ordered some t-shirts 10 days ago. They **should** come in mail this week

- **to express an obligation (not as strong as _must_)**. It is used instead of must to make rules, orders or instructions sound more polite.

> You **should** never lie to your parents

- **to say that something was expected in the past but didn't happen**. (in this case, use _should_ + _have_ + _past participle_).

> I **should have studied** more but I was too lazy
