In the category of limiting adjectives there are pronominal adjectives. Pronominal adjectives are pronouns which are used to modify nouns. They would be pronouns if they stood by themselves in the place of the noun that they represent.

> **This** book is interesting (This is a pronominal adjective. It modifies the noun 'book')  
> **This** is an interesting book. (This is a pronoun. It represents the noun 'book')

Pronominal adjectives can be subdivided into the following groups:

- **demonstrative adjectives** (this, that, these, those)

> **Those** shoes were old-fashioned. **These** shoes are much better

- **possessive adjectives** (my, your, his, her, its, our, their)

> **Their** cat likes to sleep on the floor

- **distributive adjectives** (each, every, either, neither)

> **Every** attempt was met with suspicion

- **interrogative adjectives** (which, what, whose)

> **Whose** pants are these?

- **indefinite adjectives** (some, any, all, few, several, many, both, little, much, more, most)

> **Both** parents were present
