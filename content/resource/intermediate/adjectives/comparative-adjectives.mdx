title: Comparative Adjectives
description: Comparative adjectives are used to compare differences between the two objects they modify
---

Most adjectives can show degree of quality or quantity by forming two degrees of comparison: the comparative and the superlative degree. These degrees are formed from the positive degree, which is the usual form of adjectives.

| Positive                   | Comparative                              | Superlative                     |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| _This is a tall building._ | _This building is taller than that one._ | _This is the tallest building._ |

Comparative adjectives are used to compare differences between the two objects they modify. When forming the comparative degree follow the pattern _**noun**/**pronoun** (subject) + **verb** + **comparative adjective** + **than** + **noun**/**pronoun** (object)_.

> My room is **larger** than Jake's

The second item of comparison can be omitted if it is clear from the context that something is being compared to something else.

> If you start working out you'll get **thinner**. (=You'll get thinner in comparison to your past self.)

Comparative adjectives with one syllable are normally formed by adding `-er` to the adjective.

> smart - smart**er**

if an adjective has a _consonant_ + _single vowel_ + _consonant_ spelling, the final consonant must be _doubled_ before adding `-er`.

> big - big**ger**

Adjectives ending in _consonant_ + _-y_ change _-y_ to _-i_ and add _-er_,

> dry - dr**ier**

Adjectives with two syllables can form the comparative either by adding `-er` or by preceding the adjective with `more`.

> happy - happ**ier**  
> tangled - **more** tangled

In many cases, both forms are used, although one usage will be more common than the other. If you are not sure whether a two-syllable adjective can take a comparative ending, use `more` instead.

Adjectives with three or more syllables form the comparative by preceding the adjective with `more`.

> beautiful - **more** beautiful

Some adjectives do not follow any of the rules explained earlier. They are compared irregularly. Here are the most common irregular adjectives.

| Positive    | Comparative       | Superlative             |
| :---------- | :---------------- | ----------------------- |
| _good_      | _better_          | _the best_              |
| _bad_       | _worse_           | _the worst_             |
| _far_       | _farther/further_ | _the farthest/furthest_ |
| _little_    | _less_            | _the least_             |
| _much/many_ | _more_            | _the most_              |

## Guided Practice

<Sidenote mt={8}>
  When forming the comparative degree follow the pattern _noun/pronoun (Subject) + verb +
  comparative adjective + than + noun/pronoun (object)_
</Sidenote>

- Adam is (tall) <Blank /> than Jim. <InfoTooltip label="taller" />

<Sidenote>
  {`
  - vowel + cons → double cons + -er
  - cons + -y → const + -i + -er
  - two syllables + -er OR more
  - three syllables + more`}
</Sidenote>

- heavy → <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="heavier" />
- fat → <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="fatter" />
- hot → <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="hotter" />
- easy → <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="easier" />
- wealthy → <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="wealthier / more wealthy" />
- important → <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="more important" />
- difficult → <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="more difficult" />

## Short Story using Comparative Adjectives

–_How are you doing?_

–_I'm OK. And how are you?_

–_I'm fine, thank you! I must say that you look **more tired** in comparison to when I saw you last time._

–_Yeah, my life is definitely **more complicated** now. I'm finishing my studies and... I'm craving for sleep! I try to choose **healthier** options when I eat. I try to be **more active** but it doesn't help when you sleep 4 hours a day._

–_I totally get you! Life was definitely **easier** when we were kids._
