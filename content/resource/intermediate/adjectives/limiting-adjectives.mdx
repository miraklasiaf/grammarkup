title: Limiting Adjectives
description: Limiting adjectives help to define or limit a noun or pronoun by telling which one, what kind, or how many.
---

An adjective is a word or set of words that modifies (i.e. describes) a noun (e.g girl, boy etc.) or pronoun (e.g. we, it etc). Adjectives may come before or after the word they modify.

> This is a **cute** cat. This cat is **cute**

There are many kinds of adjectives. Among them there is a category of limiting adjectives. They help to define or "limit" a noun or pronoun by telling which one, what kind, or how many.

> **This** sandwich is delicious

There are the following categories of limiting adjectives:

- **articles** are the most commonly used adjectives. `A`, `an`, `the` indicate whether the noun is used indefinitely or definitely.

> There is **a** bed, **a** mirror, **a** wardrobe, and **an** easel in **the** room

- **demonstratives adjectives** are adjectives that are used to modify a noun so that we know which specific person, place, or thing is mentioned. The most common demonstratives adjectives are `this`, `that`, `these`, `those`.

> **This** is July, and **that** girl other there is Judy

- **numerals** can function as limiting adjectives limiting the noun to a specific number or amount.

> **One** chocolate bar, **two** cups of coffee, and **ten** hours of hard work were put into this

- **indefinite adjectives** are used to describe a noun in a non-specifc sense. The most common indefinite adjectives are `any`, `each`, `few`, `many`, `much`, `most`, `several`, `some`. They are often used to describe a noun showing an element of uncertainty.

> There were **several** people in the room

## Guided Practice

<Sidenote mt={8}>
  Use articles _a_, _an_, _the_ to indicate whether the noun is used indefinitely or definitely.
</Sidenote>

- There is <Blank /> laptop, <Blank /> cup, <Blank /> open envelope, and <Blank /> pile of books on <Blank /> table. It is <Blank /> total mess. <InfoTooltip label="There is a laptop, a cup, an open envelope, and a pile of books on the table. It is a total mess." />

<Sidenote>
  Use demonstrative adjectives _this_, _that_, _these_, _those_ to indicate which specific person,
  place, or things is mentioned.
</Sidenote>

- <Blank /> shoes are quite nice. They'd go well with <Blank /> red dress. <InfoTooltip label="These/those, this/that" />

<Sidenote>
  Use numerals to limit the noun to a specific number or amount. Spot these numerals.
</Sidenote>

- Sorry, but we can't throw a party for one person. We should invite at least twenty people. <InfoTooltip label="one, twenty" />

<Sidenote>
  Use indefinite adjectives _any, each, few, many, much, most, several, some_ to describe a noun by
  showing an element of uncertainty. Spot these adjectives.
</Sidenote>

- The most important thing in the world is to be humane. <InfoTooltip label="most" />

<Sidenote>
  Do not confuse indefinite adjectives with indefinite pronouns. indefinite adjectives modify nouns
  or pronouns. indefinite pronouns are standalone pronouns.
</Sidenote>

- There are only **a few** people left. <InfoTooltip label="indefinite adjectives" />
- There are only **a few** left. <InfoTooltip label="indefinite pronouns" />
