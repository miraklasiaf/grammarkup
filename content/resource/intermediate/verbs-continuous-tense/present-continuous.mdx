We use the present continuous when we talk about something which is happening at the time of speaking, or actions happening "around now", even though not at the moment of speaking.

The present continuous also has some future meanings.

> Hey, what are you doing? - I am working on my thesis. I am graduating this semester

The present continuous is formed with the auxiliary verb `to be` and the `-ing` form of the main verb.

This is contracted in speech and informal writing. Questions are formed by inverting the subject and the auxiliary verb `to be`. Negatives are formed with the verb `to be` + `not`. This is also contracted in speech and informal writing.

> (+) He **is sleeping** on the couch in the living room./He's sleeping there  
> (-) He **is not sleeping** on the couch in the living room./He isn't sleeping there  
> (?) Where is he? **Is he sleeping**?

Some time markers can show that we talk about something which is happening at the time of speaking, or actions happening "around now". THese time markers are `now`, `right now`, `at the moment`, `today`, `this week` etc.

> I'm quite busy **this year** as I'm trying to start my small business.

We also use the present continuous when we talk about changing situations.

> ~~The population of the world increases very fast~~. The population of the world is increasing very fast

## Guided Practice

<Sidenote mt={8}>
  Use the present form of _to be_ and the _-ing_ form of the main verb to make sentences in the
  present continuous.
</Sidenote>

- I (to fry) potatoes, my mom (to wash) the dishes, and my brothers (to wait) patiently for dinner to be ready. <InfoTooltip label="I am frying potatoes, my mom is washing the dishes, and my brothers are patiently waiting for dinner to be ready." />

<Sidenote>
  Form question by inverting the subject and _to be_. Forms negatives with _to be_ + not. Use
  contracted forms.
</Sidenote>

- (it/to rain) outside? - No, it (not to rain). It's a bit cloudy but kids (to play) outside anyway. <InfoTooltip label="Is it raining outside? No, it isn't raining. It's a bit cloudy but kids are playing outside anyway." />

<Sidenote>Find time markers.</Sidenote>

- Samantha is taking Chinese classes this year. She is studying a lot. <InfoTooltip label="this year" />

<Sidenote>Use the present continuous to talk about changing situations.</Sidenote>

- The economic situation is already bad but it (to get) worse. <InfoTooltip label="The economic situation is already bad but it is getting worse." />
