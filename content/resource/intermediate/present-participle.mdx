---

Most commonly we use the present participle `-ing` as an element in all continuous verb forms (the present continuous, the past continuous etc.).

The auxiliary verb indicated the tense, while the present participle remains unchanging.

> **I was playing** computer games all night (past continuous)

The present participle if formed by adding `-ing` to the base form of the verb.

- Verbs ending in `-e` drop `-e` and add `-ing`.

> like - liking  
> write - writing

- Verbs with one syllable, ending in one vowel and one consonant, double the consonant and add `-ing`.

> sit - sitting  
> swim - swimming

- Verbs ending `-ie` change `-ie` to `-y` and add `-ing`.

> lie - lying  
> die - dying

The present participle is used not only fo form verb tenses. It can be used:

- after verbs of movement and position (often after the verb `to go`)

> She went **shopping**  
> They came **running** towards me

- after verbs of perception in the pattern `verb` + `object` + `present participle` to indicate the action being perceived.

> We saw him **mowing** the lawn  
> Liz heard someone **singing**

- after verbs of movement, action, or position to indicated parallel activity.

> He sat **looking** at the pedestrians  
> July walks **reading** her newspaper

- as an adjective.

> Have you heard of that **amazing** movie?  
> The family was trapped inside the **burning** barn

- to explain the cause or reason. The present participle is used instead of a phrase starting with `as`, `since`, `because`.

> **Feeling** hungry, I made myself a sandwich. (=I made myself a sandwich **because** I was hungry.)  
> **Knowing** that his roommate was coming, James cleaned the living room (=James cleaned the living room **as** he knew that his roommate was coming.)
