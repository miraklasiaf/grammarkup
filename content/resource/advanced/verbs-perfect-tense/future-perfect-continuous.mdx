We use the future perfect continuous when we describe an action (quite a long one) that has begun sometime in the past, present, or future, and is expected to continue in the future. In this case, we are projecting ourselves forward in time and looking back at the duration of that action.

> When Peter turns 40, he **will have been painting** for 35 years

The future perfect continuous is formed with `will` + `have` + `been` + `the present participle`. Questions are formed by inverting the subject and _will_. Negatives are formed with _not_. Contracted forms are used.

> (+) At 6 o'clock I **will have been waiting** here for an hour / At that time I'll have been waiting here for an hour  
> (-) I **won't have been waiting** here for an hour at 6 o'clock  
> (?) **Will** I **have been waiting** here for an hour at 6 o'clock?

We often use `by` + `time expression` with the future perfect continuous to show that the situation has begun sometime in the past, present, or future, and is expected to continue in the future.

> **By 2025** he'll have been living in London for 10 years

We can also use `when`, `as soon as`, `before`, or `by the time` to show the sequence of events. In this case, use the present simple tense in the parts with _when, by the time_ etc.

> **When** I complete my studies, I'll have been learning English for 17 years

Remember that **non-continuous verbs** (_e.g. to love, hate, know, want, etc._) **are not used** in any continuous tenses. Use the future perfect instead.

> ~~In March I'll have been knowing you for a year.~~ In March I'll have known you for a year

## Short Story using Future Perfect Continuous

窶点I've just realized that **by the time they finish their trip, they'll have been hiking for more that 25 days.**_

窶点Yeah, I know! **And they won't have been sleeping in bed or having a shower in almost a month!**_

窶点Yeah. Well, at least they won't be that picky about the food then! **When we pick them up, they will have been eating canned food for weeks.**_

窶点Maybe taking them straight to the buffet is a better idea..._
