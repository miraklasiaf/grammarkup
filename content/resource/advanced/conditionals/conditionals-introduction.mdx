Conditionals are sentences with two clauses - a main clause and an _if_ clause. Conditionals state that the action in the main clause can only take place if a certain condition in the _if_ clause is fulfilled.

> **If** we don't hurry, we will be late!

The order of the main clause and _if_ clauses is not fixed. Although when the _if_ clause precedes the main one, use a comma.

There are five main types of conditionals in English:

- **zero conditionals** -- are used to describe things that are always or generally true. Thus we refer to the real and possible situations, general truths, or scientific facts. Zero conditionals follow the pattern:

|       If + present simple       | present simple |
| :-----------------------------: | :------------: |
| _**If** the food is too spicy,_ |  _drink milk_  |

- **Conditionals type 1 or first conditionals** -- are used to describe future events that will happen or are likely to happen. These sentences are based on facts, thus we make statements about the real world or particular situation. First conditionals follow the pattern:

|               If + present simple               |    future simple     |
| :---------------------------------------------: | :------------------: |
| _**If** everything goes according to the plan,_ | _we'll be very rich_ |

- **Conditionals type 2 or second conditionals** -- are used to describe hypothetical, unlikely, or impossible situations. These sentences are not based on facts, thus we can refer to any time. Second conditionals follow the pattern:

|      If + past simple       |              would + V              |
| :-------------------------: | :---------------------------------: |
| _**If** I won the lottery,_ | _I would put the money in the bank_ |

- **Conditionals type 3 or third conditionals** -- are used to describe a past event that is different to what really happened. These sentences are solely hypothetical, thus there is always some implication of regret. Third conditionals follow the pattern:

|      If + past perfect       |   would have + Ved/past participle    |
| :--------------------------: | :-----------------------------------: |
| _**If** we hadn't slept in,_ | _we wouldn't have missed your flight_ |

- **Mixed conditionals** -- refer to conditional sentences that combine two different types of conditional patterns. They are used to refer to a time in the past, and a situation that is ongoing in the present. Mixed conditionals usually follow the pattern:

|       If + past perfect        |            would + V             |
| :----------------------------: | :------------------------------: |
| _**If** they had argued less,_ | _they would be a perfect couple_ |

## Guided Practice

**Follow the patterns and write down the sentences.**

## Short Story using Conditionals

窶点**If** you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be and why?_

窶点**If** I could live anywhere, I would move to Japan. I think this country is simply amazing. And it's very safe there._

窶点Well, **if** you learn Japanese, you can move there._

窶点**If** I had studied it at high school, I would be there already. It's a dream of mine to live there at some point._

## Independent Practice

**Decide which conditional is used.**

1. If you listened to me, you would remember the story. <InfoTooltip label="Type 2" />

2. If I find you scarf at my place, I'll let you know. <InfoTooltip label="Type 1" />

3. Kids love playing outside when it is summer. <InfoTooltip label="Zero conditional" />

4. If my mom had come later, she wouldn't have noticed the mess. <InfoTooltip label="Type 3" />

5. We would use public transport less often if we bought the car. <InfoTooltip label="Type 2" />

**Choose the correct word or phrase in the following sentences.**

1. What would we do if we `miss`/`missed` our bus? <InfoTooltip label="missed" />

2. He `would have freak out`/`would have freaked out` if his wife had spent all his money on clothes. <InfoTooltip label="would have freaked out" />

3. I would be surprised if he `didn't know`/`didn't knew` the answer. <InfoTooltip label="didn't know" />

4. If you decide to go out with your friends tonight, `let me know`/`will you let me know` in advance. <InfoTooltip label="let me know" />
