Zero conditionals are used to describe things that are always or generally true. Thus we refer to the real and possible situations, general truths, or scientific facts.

> **If** two people fall in love, they become a couple (In general, people become a couple if they fall in love with each other)

The order of the main clause and _if_ clauses is not fixed. Although when the _if_ clause precedes the main one, use a comma.

Use the present simple tense in both parts of the zero conditionals. Note that the order of the main and _if_ clauses is not fixed. Although when the _if_ clause precedes the main one, use a comma.

|             IF clause (If + present simple)              |     MAIN clause (present simple)     |
| :------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------: |
| _**If** the temperature **is** above 0 degrees outside,_ |         _the snow **melts**_         |
|           _**If** my friend invites me over,_            | _I always **accept** her invitation_ |

Note that we can use `when` instead of `if` without any changes in the meaning.

> **When** winter comes, the birds fly to the south

Zero conditionals are often used to give instructions. In this case, we use the imperatives in the main clause.

> **Call me** if you need any help  
> If you are not satisfied with your major, **change it**

## Guided Practice

<Sidenote mt={8}>
  Zero conditionals are used to describe things that are always or generally true. Thus we refer to
  the real and possible situations, general truths, or scientific facts. Mark the main clause as M
  and the _if_ clause as IF.
</Sidenote>

- People close their eyes (<Blank />) when they get scared (<Blank />). <InfoTooltip label="M, IF" />
- Pupils can be expelled (<Blank />) if they don't respect school rules (<Blank />). <InfoTooltip label="M, IF" />
- If you want to buy something sweet (<Blank />), go to the supermarket (<Blank />). <InfoTooltip label="IF, M" />

**Use the present simple tense in both parts of the zero conditionals.**

`when` - `people` - `to throw away` - `plastic bottles` - `we` - `to pollute` - `our planet`. <InfoTooltip label="When people throw away plastic bottles, we pollute our planet" />

`if` - `it` - `to be late` - `not to go home` - `alone`. <InfoTooltip label="If it is late, don't go home alone" />
