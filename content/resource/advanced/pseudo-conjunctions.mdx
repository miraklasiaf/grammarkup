Conjunctions are words that link other words, phrases, clauses, or sentences together.

> Susan is an amazing wife **and** a wonderful mom

Pseudo conjunctions are other parts of speech that act like conjunctions:

- **adverbial conjunctions (also called conjunctive adverbs)** -- are used to indicated a relationship between sentences and independent clauses by comparing or contrasting ideas (_e.g consequently, finally, however, otherwise, then etc._). We usually use commas to separate an adverbial conjuntion from the rest of the sentence.

> John's mom wanted him to go to college. **Instead**, he took a gap year and travelled aroung the world

- **nominal conjunctions** introduce or conclude ideas (_ e.g. the moment, the instant etc._). Nominal conjunctions function as nouns in a sentence.

> I was petrified **the moment** I heard the news

- **verbal conjunctions** -- are used to introduce additional information in a sentence (_e.g. assuming (that), given (that) etc._). Verbal conjunctions are derived from verbs.

> Shall we go out tonight **assuming that** you are free?
