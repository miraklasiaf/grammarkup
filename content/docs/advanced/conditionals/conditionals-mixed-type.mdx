Mixed conditionals refer to conditional sentences that combine two different types of conditional patterns. The mixed conditional is used to refer to a time in the past, and a situation that is ongoing in the present.

<Callout title="Example">
 **If** I had won the lottery, I would buy a huge house. (I didn't win the lottery in the past and I'm living in a small apartment right now.)
</Callout>

The most common mixed conditional is when we have a third conditional in the _if_ clause _(if + past perfect)_ followed by second conditional _(would + the base form of the verb)_ in the main clause.
Note that the order of the main and _if_ clauses are not fixed. Although when the _if_ clause precedes the main one, use a comma.

|         IF clause (If + past perfect)          | MAIN clause (would + V) |
| :----------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------: |
|          _**If** Kate had studied more,_          |   _she would have a better GPA._    |
| _**If** he had started plainting the picture in June_ | _it would be finished now._ |

The less common mixed conditional is when we have a second conditional in the _if_ clause _(if + past simple)_ followed by a third conditional _(would have + the past participle)_ in the main clause.
This conditional refers to an unreal present situation and its possible (but unreal) past result.

<Callout title="Example">
 **If** I weren't afraid of flying, I would have travelled by air. (I am afraid of flying in general. And that time I travelled by train.)
</Callout>

- **If I were more** <Blank /> <Tooltip content="outgoing, I would have partied every week." />

I was invited to their dinner party so I didn't stay at home all day.

- **If I weren't** <Blank /> <Tooltip content="invited to their dinner party, I would have stayed at home all day." />

## Short Story using Conditionals Mixed Type

–_This is kind of upsetting. I know that **if** I had studied more, I would pass the exams successfully and choose another major._

–_If you feel like you have enough motivation, you can still try. It's never too late to start, right?_
