Conditionals type 2 or second conditionals are used to describe hypothetical, unlikely, or impossible situations. These sentences are not based on facts, thus we can refer to any time.

> **If** Peter cleaned his place, he would let us come in.

Use the past simple tense in the `if clause` and `would + V` in the main clause. Note that the order of the main and _if_ clauses is not fixed. Although when the _if_ clause precedes the main one, use a comma.

|       IF clause (If + past simple)       |     MAIN clause (would + V)     |
| :--------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------: |
|    _**If** I won 1 million dollars,_     |  _I would give it to charity._  |
| _**If** you found a formal black dress,_ | _it would look perfect on you._ |

Note that if we use the verb `to be` in the _if_ clause, the form `were` is used even with the 1st and 3rd person. We often use "If I were you..." to express our opinion or to give advice.

> **If I were** a chef, I would work at some Italian restaurant  
> **If I were you**, I wouldn't take that job

Compare the first conditional and the second conditional:

> (It is December right now) If it snows today, we will definitely make a snowman  
> (It is May right now) If it snowed today, we would be surprised

## Guided Practice

<Callout mt={8}>
  Second conditionals are used to describe hypothetical, unlikely, or impossible
  situations. Mark first conditionals as FC and second conditionals as SC.
</Callout>

- If I've seen it earlier, I'll let you know. (<Blank />). <Tooltip content="FC" />
- If I were you, I would go on trip with us. (<Blank />). <Tooltip content="SC" />
- If he cheated, she would dump him at once. (<Blank />). <Tooltip content="SC" />

**Use the past simple tense in the _if_ clause and would + V in the main clause.**

`What` - `your dog` - `to say` - `if` - `it` - `can` - `to speak?` <Tooltip content="What would your dog say if it could speak?" />

`What` - `you` - `to buy` - `if` - `you` - `to have` - `only 10 dollars`. <Tooltip content="What would you buy if you had only 10 dollars" />

## Short Story using Conditionals Type 2

–_**If** I knew what to do, it would help me a lot._

–_**If** I were you, I would just listen to my guts._

–_**If** I listened to my inner voice, I would certainly make a stupid decision in this situation. I make stupid decisions **when** I'm stressed._

-_At least it would be your own decision._

## Independent Practice

**Match the sentences.**

|                                               |                                               |                              |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| a. I don't have an umbrella, so if it rained, | 1. we would buy a bigger house.               | <Tooltip content="(a, 3)" /> |
| b. If I won a lottery,                        | 2. if you saw a kitten at your entrance door? | <Tooltip content="(b, 6)" /> |
| c. If we had more money,                      | 3. I would get wet.                           | <Tooltip content="(c, 1)" /> |
| d. If I were you,                             | 4. I would buy these shoes.                   | <Tooltip content="(d, 4)" /> |
| e. What would you do                          | 5. If he worked out more.                     | <Tooltip content="(e, 2)" /> |
| f. If they didn't like each other,            | 6. I would travel around the world.           | <Tooltip content="(f, 7)" /> |
| g. Terry would be a bodybuilder               | 7. they wouldn't be friends.                  | <Tooltip content="(g, 5)" /> |

**Write three sentences with second conditionals.**

1. <Blank />
   <Tooltip content="Where would you be if you could live anywhere in the world?" />

2. <Blank /> <Tooltip content="If I were you, I would ask him out." />

3. <Blank />
   <Tooltip content="If there were more shops nearby, I wouldn't have to spend 30 minutes on a drive." />
