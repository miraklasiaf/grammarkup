---

A dependent (subordinate) clause gives additional information to the main sentence, thus it cannot stand alone as a separate sentence.

<Callout title="Example">
  **When she comes back home after a long day at work**, she likes to take a bath.
</Callout>

Dependent clauses can be divided into the following categories:

- a noun clause is a dependent clause that acts as a noun, thus it can be a subject, an object, or an object of a preposition in the sentence.

<Callout title="Example">
  **Whoever comes first** wins!

  We don't know **who left the note at the door**.
</Callout>

- an adjective clause is a dependent clause that modifies nouns or pronouns providing additional information.

<Callout title="Example">
  A woman **who can cook well** will become my wife.

  Broccoli, **which not everyone likes**, is part of my daily diet.
</Callout>

- an adverb clause is a dependent clause that modifies an adjective, an adverb, or a verb/verb phrase.

<Callout title="Example">
  We were swimming in the ocean **when we saw the lightning**.

  Let's eat dinner **before the food gets cold**.
</Callout>

## Guided Practice

<Callout type="success">
  A dependent (subordinate) clause gives additional information to the main sentence, thus it cannot stand alone as a separate sentence.
</Callout>

**Underline dependent clauses.**

- As long as you are honest with me, we can be together. <Tooltip content="As long as you are honest with me" />

- Sarah loves going to her grandma, whose pies are the best thing in the world. <Tooltip content="whose pies are the best thing in the world" />

- I didn't want to go home; it was cold and empty. <Tooltip content="no dependent clauses" />

**Mask a noun clause as N, an adjective clause as ADJ, and an adverb clause as ADV.**

- **No matter what we do**, the outcome remains the same. <Tooltip content="ADV" />

- You can be **whomever you want**. <Tooltip content="N" />

- July **who works in HR** is a good friend of mine. <Tooltip content="ADJ" />
