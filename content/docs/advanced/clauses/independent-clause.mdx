---

An independent (main) clause contains a subject and a predicate and expresses a finished thought. Thus it can stand alone as a sentence.

<Callout title="Example">
  Sarah wants to study Spanish.
</Callout>

The independent clause is a simple sentence when dependent clauses within one sentence are absent.

<Callout title="Example">
I don't want to go to the pub tonight. (simple sentence)

I have to work tomorrow. (simple sentence)
</Callout>

The independent clause forms a complex sentence together with a dependent clause. In this case, use a conjunction.

<Callout title="Example">
  I don't want to go to the pub tonight **because** I have to work tomorrow. (two clauses are connected with the help of a conjunction **because**)
</Callout>

Two independent clauses can form a sentence. In this case, use a semicolon (_;_).

<Callout title="Example">
My little sister doesn't like reading; she falls asleep within 2 minutes.

Lucy has a business trip in a week; Lucy's mom will help with the kids.
</Callout>
