A clause is a combination of words containing a subject and a predicate.

<Callout title="Example">
Peter goes to the gym. (one clause)

Peter goes to the gym after he finishes this work. (two clauses)
</Callout>

There are two types of clauses in English:

- an independent (main) clause contains a subject and a predicate and expresses a finished thought. Thus it can stand alone as a complete sentence.

<Callout title="Example">
Pam likes drawing and painting.

Andy is currently unemployed.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Note">
The independent clause is a simple sentence when dependent clauses within one sentence are absent.
</Callout>

- a dependent (subordinate) clause gives additional information to the main sentence, thus it cannot stand alone as a separate sentence.

<Callout title="Example">
Mr. Klarkson, **whose works are critically acclaimed**, has published a new book.

Mary started laughing **when** she saw a pug wearing a costume.
</Callout>

An independent clause forms a complex sentence together with a dependent clause.

<Callout title="Example">
I'd like to know **why I can't book a room at this hotel**.

The woman stood crying **as people were passing by**.
</Callout>

## Guided Practice

<Callout type="success">
  An independent clause contains a subject and a predicate and expresses a finished thought. A dependent clause gives additional information to the main sentence.
</Callout>

**Underline dependent clause.**

- Since you refused to come with me, I'll go alone. <Tooltip content="Since you refused to come with me" />

- The weather is wonderful; everyone is outside. <Tooltip content="No dependent clause" />

- John's grandpa, whose kind words were like a guiding light, passed away. <Tooltip content="whose kind words were like a guiding light" />

**Rewrite the sentences so that there is an independent and a dependent clause.**

I don't want to go outside; it's raining. <Tooltip content="I don't want to go outside because it's raining." />

Finish you work and call me. <Tooltip content="Call me after you finish your work." />

## Short Story using Sentence Clause

–_I haven't asked my family if they plan on doing a huge family gathering._

–_Well, until you get the details, we can't book anything._

–_I understand that. I promise that I'll call my parents today. You can join us; everyone is super friendly._

–_I'm not sure that I'm ready to meet your huge family yet._
