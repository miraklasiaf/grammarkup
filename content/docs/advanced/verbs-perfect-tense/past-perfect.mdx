We use the past perfect to show clearly that one past event happened before another past event. We use the past perfect for the earlier event.

> When I arrived at the party, Tom wasn't there. **He had gone home** <Asterisk label="Tom went home at 10.00, I arrived at 11.00" />

The past perfect is formed with the auxiliary verb `had` and `the past participle` (third column in the list of irregular verbs). Question are formed by inverting the subject and _had_. Negatives are formed with _not_. Contracted forms are used.

> (?) **Had** Kate **gone** to bed when you arrived home?  
> (+) **Yes, she had**. She **had gone** to bed when I arrived home. / She'**d gone** to bed  
> (-) **No, she hadn't**. She **hadn't gone** to bed when I arrived home

The past perfect (I had done) is the past of the present perfect (I have done). Compare these situations:

|                   Present                   |                         Past                          |
| :-----------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------: |
|  I'm not hungry. I've just had breakfast.   |       I wasn't hungry. I'd just had breakfast.        |
| Your room is dirty. You haven't cleaned it. | You room was dirty. You hadn't cleaned it for months. |

The past perfect is often used with verbs of thinking like `to think`, `know`, `be sure`, `realize`, `remember`, `suspect`, `understand` etc.

> She **was sure** she hadn't locked the door  
> When I got home I **realized** I'd left my computer at Starbucks

Note that it is not necessary to use the past perfect if we use `before` or `after` to make the time sentence clear, although many speakers do so to show a strong connection between the two events.

> Pam left her house before her parents arrived (past simple)  
> Pam **had left** her house before her parents arrived (past simple + past perfect)
