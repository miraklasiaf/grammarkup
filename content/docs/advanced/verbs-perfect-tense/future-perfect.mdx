We use the future perfect to look back from one point in the future to an earlier event. The situations has not happened yet, but at a certain time in future it will happen.

> By next week I'**ll have written** 20 pages for my new book

The future perfect is formed with `will` + `have` + `the past participle`. Questions are formed by inverting the subject and _will_. Negatives are formed with _not_. Contracted forms are used.

> (+) John **will have arrived** here by 5 p.m. tomorrow  
> (-) He **won't have arrived** here by 5 p.m. tomorrow  
> (?) **Will** he **have arrived** here by 5 p.m. tomorrow?

We often use `by` + `time expression` with the future perfect to show that the situations has not happened yet, but at a certain time in the future it will happen.

> Won't they have invited us **by Friday**?  
> James will have finished his thesis **by this time next week**

We can also use `when`, `as soon as`, `before`, or `by the time` to show the sequence of events. In this case, use the present simple tense in the parts with _when, by the time_ etc.

> Will you have dressed up **when I pick you up**?  
> **By the time you read this** I will have left the city

Remember that the future perfect is used only for actions that will be completed by a particular time in the future. If the deadline is not mentioned, use the future simple instead.

> She will leave her home town  
> ~~She will have left her hometown.~~ She will have left her hometown by this time next year
