We use the present perfect to describe past events which are connected to the present.

> Sam has lost his keys (=He is looking for his keys and he still hasn't found them)

The present perfect is formed with the present tense of the auxiliary verb `to have` and `the past participle` (third column in the list of irregular verbs). Question are formed by inverting the subject and _have_/_has_. Negatives are formed with _not_. Contracted forms are used.

> (+) I **have** already **seen** that movie / I'**ve** already **seen** that movie  
> (-) I **have not seen** that movie yet / I **haven't seen** it yet  
> (?) **Have** I **seen** that movie?

The present perfect describes past events which are connected to the present, although this tense can be used to describe different situations:

- **experiences in our life up to now**

> I'**ve been** to Spain and Portugal. I really want to go to the UK. I **haven't been** there **yet**.

- **an event in the past that has a result in the present**

> Lili **has broken** her foot. Her foot is still in a cast

- **a situation that started in the past and continues until the present**

> I'**ve lived** here for twenty tears. And I am still living here now

- **how many things are completed so far**

> Peter **has read** 50 pages of this book so far. There are 150 pages left.

Pay attention to the time markers:

- we use `ever` and `never` when we ask or talk about our experiences in life

> Have you **ever** eated Chinese food? - I'**ve never** eaten it

- we use `already` in positive sentences to describe an action which has happened before. We use `yet` in questions and negative sentences to describe an action which hasn't happened before.

> I haven't finished this book **yet**, and my sister has **already** begun reading another one

- we use `just` when we describe a very recent event

> My mom has **just** come home from work

- such frequency adverbs as `always`, `often` etc. can also be used with the present perfect

> He has **always** loved Ann

- we use `for` to describe the length of a time period. We use `since` to describe the point when the time period started

> Chris has worked here **for 5 months**. He has worked here since **May 5th**

## Guided Practice

<Callout mt={8}>
  Use the auxiliary verb _to have_ and _the past participle_ to make sentences in the
  present perfect. Form questions by inverting the subject and _have/has_. Form negatives
  with not. Use contracted forms.
</Callout>

- (anything/to happen) interesting since I left? - Yeah. Ashley and Peter (to decide) to get married, Monica (to get) her driving license, but aunt Pauline (not to give up) smoking yet. <Tooltip content="Has anything interesting happened since I left? - Yeah. Ashley and Peter have decided to get married, Monica has got her driving license, but aunt Pauline hasn't given up smoking yet." />

<Callout>
  Note that the present perfect can be used to describe different situations.
</Callout>

- I (to be) to Poland and Czech Republic. I (not to be) to Hungary yet. <Tooltip content="I've been to Poland and Czech Republic. I haven't been to Hungary yet." />
- Patrick (to crush) his car. He has to take a bus to work. <Tooltip content="Patrick has crushed his car. He has to take a bus to work." />
- She (to work) for this company for 5 years. She deserves a pay rise. <Tooltip content="She's worked for this company for 5 years. She deserves a pay rise." />
- I (to write) the introduction part so far. I (not to do) anything else. <Tooltip content="I've written the introduction part so far. I haven't done anything else" />

**Use time markers.**

`never` - `for` - `yet` - `ever` - `since` - `already`

- Has your brother <Blank /> helped you with homework? - He has <Blank /> done that actually! <Tooltip content="ever, never" />
- Have you made up your mind <Blank /> ? - Yes, I've <Blank /> decided what to do. I've just booked my flights. <Tooltip content="yet, already" />
- Rob has played football <Blank /> he was a kid. He has played football every day <Blank /> 15 years. <Tooltip content="since, for" />
