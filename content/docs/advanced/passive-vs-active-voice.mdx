In sentences written in the active voice, the subject performs the action. In sentences written in the passive voice, the subject receives the action.

> I **wrote** a book (Active voice)  
> That book **was written** by me (Passive voice)

The passive form is made up of the verb `to be` and `the past participle`. Depending on the tense, the form of the verb `to be` can change.

> The dinner is **being cooked** (Present continuous)  
> The dinner **was cooked** (Past simple)  
> The dinner **has been cooked** (Present perfect)

The passive voice is usually used:

- **to emphasize the action rather than the person or thing performing it**

> The decision **has been made**

- **to avoid mentioning the person or thing performing the action**

> The rumours **have been spreading** at the office. (Either you know who spreads the rumours or you are not sure who does that)

- **to describe a situation where the subject is not important**

> Up to 7 billion trees **are being cut down** every year

- **to give instructions, set rules etc.**

> Smoking **is prohibited**  
> Anyone under the age of 18 **is not allowed** in any bar
