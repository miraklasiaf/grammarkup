title: Proper Nouns
description: A proper noun is a noun that refers to a unique thing
---

A proper noun is a noun that refers to a unique thing, such as (names, names of cities, planets, corporations etc.).

<Callout title="Example">**London** is the capital of **Great Britain**</Callout>

Note that proper nouns are unique names. They are capitalized.

<Callout title="Example">**Olivia** wants to travel around **Europe** next year</Callout>

We should also capitalize:

- Festivals

<Callout title="Example">
  **Christmas** and **Thanksgiving** are my two favourite holidays!
</Callout>

- People's titles

<Callout title="Example">
  Everything depends on **President** Trump and his decision
</Callout>

- The names of books, films, plays, and paintings. We use capital letters for the nouns, adjectives, and verbs in the titles.

<Callout title="Example">
  I've just finished reading '**The Old Man and the Sea**'
</Callout>

Sometimes we use a person's name to refer to something they have created.

<Callout title="Example">
  We were listening to **Mozart** the other day

I'm reading **an Iris Murdoch** now

</Callout>

When you use a word about a family member (e.g. mom, dad, uncle), capitalize it only if the word is being used exactly as you would use a name, i.e. if you were addressing the person directly. If the word is not being used as a name, it is not capitalized.

<Callout title="Example">
  Please ask **Dad** if he can buy wine on his way home
  
Is your **dad** coming over for  dinner?

</Callout>

Whenever you see a capitalized word, question whether or not it is a proper noun. Make sure that the capitalized word is in fact a noun as there are also proper adjectives.

<Callout title="Example">
  **Asia** is one of the continents of the world <Tooltip content="Proper noun" />
  
I don't really like **Asian** food <Tooltip content="Proper adjective" />

</Callout>
