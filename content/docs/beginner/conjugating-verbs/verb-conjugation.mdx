Verb conjugation refers to how a verb changes to indicate a different person, number, tense, or mood.

> I'm a student. (1st person, singular, present simple, indicative mood)

Verbs should be conjugated with regards to person. Depending on the subject, a verb can stand in the first, second, or third person. Study the following table:

|            |  Singular   | Plural |
| :--------: | :---------: | :----: |
| 1st person |     _I_     |  _we_  |
| 2nd person |    _you_    | _you_  |
| 3rd person | _he/she/it_ | _they_ |

As you can see, the pronouns `I`, `we` refer to the first person; `you` - to the second person; `he`, `she`, `it`, `they` - to the third person.

> We work on Saturdays (first person)  
> You need to take a break (second person)  
> It is snowing outside (third person)

Usually we assume the person of the verb in the sentence automatically as we almost always state a subject explicitly.

> Sarah has signed up for a yoga class (**Sarah** can be substituted with the pronoun **she**; the verb is in the third person)

Note that the verb `to be` is irregular and has 3 forms in present tenses and 2 forms in past tenses. These forms depend on the person expressed by the subject.

|            |    Present     |            |      Past       |             |
| :--------: | :------------: | :--------: | :-------------: | :---------: |
| 1st person |     _I am_     |  _we are_  |     _I was_     |  _we were_  |
| 2nd person |   _you are_    | _you are_  |   _you were_    | _you were_  |
| 3rd person | _he/she/it is_ | _they are_ | _he/she/it was_ | _they were_ |
