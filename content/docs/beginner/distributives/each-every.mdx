title: Each - Every
description: The distributives each and every are both related to describing members of a group
---

The distributives `each` and `every` are both related to describing members of a group. These distributives can only be used with **countable nouns** by being placed before the nouns. In many cases, they are interchangeable but there is a subtle difference between them.

> **Each** person is unique  
> **Every** person is unique

## Distributive Each

`Each` is used to describe and highlight an individual member of a group, or multiple individuals. By using `each` you recognise the item is a part of a group, but that it also needs to be pointed out as a singular item too.

> **Each book** on the shelf had a unique cover

`Each` can be used with plural nouns and pronouns but must be followed by `of`.

> **Each of the pupils** received a Christmas card

`Each` can be used after the subject or at the end of a sentence.

> **My siblings each** have their own room  
> My mother gave my sister and I £20 **each** (=gave £20 to each of us.)

## Distributive Every

`Every` by constrast is a way of referring to the group as a collection of individual members. `Every` cannot be used with plural nouns

> ~~Every boys in my class wanted that computer game.~~ **Every boy** in my class wanted that computer game

`Every` can express different points in a series, especially with time expressions.

> **Every** morning Phillip goes for a run  
> And **every time** Ann would forgive him
