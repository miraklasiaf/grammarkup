Proper adjectives are formed from proper nouns and modify nouns and pronouns.

> I love **Italian** culture

A proper noun is the specific name used for any person, place, or thing. Proper adjectives typically look like their original proper noun but have some sort of alternative ending in order to make them adjectives.

> He lives in **America** (proper noun)  
> He likes **American** holidays (proper adjective)

Proper adjective are derived from proper nouns. For this reason, they are capitalized.

> When she lived in China, Liz ate a lot of **Chinese** food

When a proper adjective has a prefix, the prefix itself is never capitalized (unless it is the first word of a sentence). However, the proper adjective itself is still capitalized.

> In **pre-Columbian** America corn was the only cultivated cereal

The most common endings for nationalities are `-ian`/`-ean`/`-an`, `-ic`, `-ese`, `-i`, `-ish`. The reason that English has so many endings for different nationalities is that they were borrowed from other languages.
