title: Object Pronouns
description: An object pronoun is a pronoun that takes the place of a noun as the object of sentence
---

An object is **the person or thing that receives the action** in the clause or sentence. An object pronoun is a pronoun that takes the place of a noun as the object of sentence.

> She told **me** about her worries

<Callout>
  The word me is an object pronoun because it refers to person that is receiving the
  action.
</Callout>

Note that object pronoun comes after a verb or a preposition.

Object pronouns are used to replace nouns that are the direct or indirect object of a clause. Study the following table:

| Subject | Object |
| :-----: | :----: |
|   _I_   |  _me_  |
|  _you_  | _you_  |
|  _he_   | _him_  |
|  _she_  | _her_  |
|  _it_   |  _it_  |
|  _we_   |  _us_  |
| _they_  | _them_ |

Object pronouns come either after a verb or a preposition.

> Ethan asked **me** to talk to **them**

Note that the subject pronoun `it` and the object pronoun `it` look the same.

> Do you know the movie 'Pretty Lady'? **It** is my favourite! <Asterisk label="subject pronoun" />  
> I've seen **it** many times <Asterisk label="object pronoun" />

Remember that object nouns are always the recipients of the action in sentences.

> ~~He and me went to the movies~~. **He and I** went to the movies  
> ~~Mrs. Keith called her and I~~. Mrs. Keith called **her** and **me**

We should replace the object with an object pronoun to avoid repetition.

> I can't stop thinking about Amy. ~~I can't stop imagining my future with Amy~~. I can't stop imagining my future with **her**
