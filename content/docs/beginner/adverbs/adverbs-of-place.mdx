title: Adverbs of Place
description: Adverbs of place tell us where something happens
---

Adverbs of place tell us where something happens. They do not modify adjectives or other adverbs.

> I'm going **back** to school in a month

The adverb of place, `back` modifies the verb `going`. It tells us where we are going.

Adverbs of place are usually placed after the main verb of after the clause that they modify.

> Come **in**!  
> Helen looked **around** trying to find a familiar face in the crowd

Adverbs of place that end in `-where` express the idea of location without specifying a specific location or direction.

> I couldn't find my cat **anywhere**

Adverbs of place that end in `-wards` express movement in a particular direction.

> Our dog likes to walk **backwards**

`Here` and `there` are common adverbs of place. They give a location relative to the speaker. With verbs of movement, `here` means "towards or with the speaker" and `there` means "away from, or not with the speaker."

> You can hang your coat **here** (You are standing near a hanger.)  
> And you can put your shoes **there** (You are pointing at the shoes rack. You are not standing near it.)

`Here` and `there` are combined with prepositions to make many common adverbial phrases.

> Could you come **over here**?  
> What are you going **up there**?

`Here` and `there` are placed at the beginning of the sentence in exclamations or when emphasis is needed. They are followed by the verb if the subject is a noun or by a pronoun if the subject is a pronoun.

> **Here** comes the train!  
> **There** it is!
