Adverbs of manner tell us how something happens.

> I **carefully** read the note left on the counter

Adverbs of manner are usually placed either before the main verb or after the object.

> Tom **quickly** left the building  
> Tom left the building **quickly**

Note that such adverbs as `well`, `badly`, `hard`, `fast` are always placed after the verb.

> ~~Alice hard worked~~. Alice worked hard

When there is more than one verb in a clause, the position of the adverbs is very important.

> Samuel slowly decided to leave the party (The adverb modifies the verb 'decided'.)

> Samuel decided to leave party slowly (The adverb describes the clause 'to leave the party'.)

Sometimes a writer puts an adverb of manner at the beginning of the sentence to catch the reader's attention.

> **Confidently** she entered the room
