## Adjectives

An adjective is a word or set of words that modifies (i.e. describes) a noun or pronoun. Adjectives may come before or after the word they modify.

> This is a **cute** cat  
> This cat is **cute**

Adjectives tell us something about a person or a thing. Adjectives can modify nouns (e.g girl, boy etc.) or pronouns (e.g. we, it etc.).

> Lily is **an honest** person  
> The movie was **awful**! The plot is simply **boring**

There are many pairs of adjectives ending in `-ing` and `-ed`. Remember that if something is `-ing`, it makes you `-ed`.

> He is **excited** because the event is **exciting**  
> I am **annoyed** because this whole situation is **annoying**

Sometimes we use two or more adjectives together. Quantity/number and quality/opinion adjectives usually go before fact adjectives.

| article | quantity/number | quality/opinion |         fact         |   noun    |
| :-----: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :------------------: | :-------: |
|    a    |                 |     _nice_      |       _sunny_        | _morning_ |
|         |      _two_      |  _intelligent_  |       _young_        | _ladies_  |
|    a    |                 |   _beautiful_   | _large round wooden_ |  _table_  |

There are times when we use two or more fact adjectives. We put fact adjectives in the following order:

| article |  size  |   age   |  shape  | colour  | material/origin | purpose  |  noun   |
| :-----: | :----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-------------: | :------: | :-----: |
|    a    | _big_  |  _old_  | _round_ |         |    _wooden_     |          | _table_ |
|         |        |  _new_  |         | _white_ |                 | _tennis_ | _shoes_ |
|    a    | _tall_ | _young_ |         |         |    _Polish_     |          |  _boy_  |

## Adverbs

An adverb is word or set of words that modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Usually adverbs modify verbs, telling us how, how often, when, or where something was done.

> We walked really **slowly**

The adverbs slowly modifies the verb walked, how we walked.

An adverb is a word or set of words that modifies:

- verbs, telling how, how often, when, or where something was done.

> The cars drove **fast**

- adjectives, making them stronger or weaker.

> Ann looked **absolutely** amazing!

- other adverbs, changing their degree or precision.

> You're speaking **too** loudly
