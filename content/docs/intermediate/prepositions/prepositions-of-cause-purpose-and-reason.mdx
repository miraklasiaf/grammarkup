Prepositions of cause, purpose, and reason are used to indicate why, what for, or because of what something happens. We usually use these prepositions when we answer the question beginning with "Why?".

> **Why** don't you eat breakfast? - I don't eat breakfast **to** sleep more in the mornings

There are several commonly used prepositions of cause, purpose, and reason:

- **due to** -- is used to express the cause of the action.

> Due to her strict parents, Liz rarely went out. It was difficult for her to make friends (Her parents were the cause of her not making friends.)

- **to** -- is used to express the purpose of the action. (usually followed by a verb)

> People go to clubs **to** dance and **to** meet new people. (These two things are the purpose of people going to clubs.)

- **for** -- is used to express the reason of the action. (usually followed by a noun/pronoun or a gerund)

> He was taken to the police station **for** driving under influence. (DUI was the reason he was taken to the police station.)

`Because of` is also used to express the reason of something happening.

> I need to go home earlier **because of** my sick cat. (My cat is sick that's why I need to go home earlier.)
