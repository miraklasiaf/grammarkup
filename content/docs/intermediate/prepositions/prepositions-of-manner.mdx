Prepositions of manner are used to express the manner in which something is done. We usually use prepositions of manner when we answer the question beginning with "How?".

> **How** did she lose weight? - She lost weight **by** exercising.

There are several groups of prepositions of manner:

- **in, with** -- are used to describe the way in which something is carried out.

> She left the stage **in** tears  
> She was singing **with** tears in her eyes

- **by** -- is used to denote either a person or a means of transportation, while **with** denotes an instrument.

> This house was build **by** my grandfather  
> Helen goes to work **by** bus  
> You need to cut the cake **with** a knife

We can also use `by` + `V-ing`.

> You can't prove them wrong **by** doing nothing

- **at** -- can be used to describe aggressive behaviour. Compare the following examples:

> He talked **to** his wife (neutral)  
> He talked **at** his wife (aggressive behaviour)

We can also use the phrase `in a friendly way/manner` to describe actions.

> Mrs. Anderson spoke to me **in an extremely polite manner**

## Short Story using Prepositions of Manner

–_Alice looks amazing! How did she manage to lose weight?_

–_**By** exercising regularly!_

–_Was there some special diet?_

–_No, not really. For example, I go to work **by** bus and Alice always goes on foot. It seems obvious but you really can lose weight **by** walking everywhere._
