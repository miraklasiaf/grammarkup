Nouns can be countable or uncountable. Now let's have a look at the difference between countable nouns and uncountable nouns.

1. **Countable Nouns** -- apple, song house etc.

- Things that can be counted, even if the number might be extremely high (e.g. all the people in the world).

- Can be singular or plural.

> I have an **apple** and you have three **apples**

- You can use `a`/`an` with singular countable nouns.

> There is **a girl** outside. She is wearing **a beautiful dress**

- If you want to ask about the quantity of a countable noun, you ask `How many?` combined with the plural countable noun.

> **How many dogs** are there? – There are **five dogs**

- You can use `many`, `a few`, `few` with plural countable nouns.

> Sorry, but I didn’t take **many pictures**. I’ve got a **few relatives** leaving here

- You can use `some`, `any`, `a lot of` with plural countable nouns.

> We like singing **some** crazy songs at karaoke  
> Did you buy **any oranges**?  
> She showed **a lot of signs** of affection

2. **Uncountable Nouns** -- tea, money, love etc.

- Things that we cannot count with numbers. They may be the names for abstract ideas or qualities or for physical objects that are too small to count or shapeless (liquids, gases etc.)

- No plural form.

> We're going to have **rice** for lunch

- You can't use `a`/`an` with uncountable nouns, but you can often use the phrase `a` (`bag`, `cup` etc.) `of`.

> There is **a bowl of rice** and **a bottle of juice** on the table

- If you want to ask about the quantity of an uncountable noun, you ask `How much?` combined with the uncountable noun.

> **How much coffee** do we have left? - We don't have **much coffee** left

- You can use `much`, `a little`, `little` with uncountable nouns.

> We didn't do **much** shopping there. We have **a little sugar** left  
> We have **a little** sugar left

- You can use `some`, `any`, `a lot of` with uncountable nouns.

> We listened to **some music** there  
> I didn't buy **any orange juice**  
> There is **a lot of love** in the air
