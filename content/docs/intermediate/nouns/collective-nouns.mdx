---

A collective noun is used to refer to an entire group of people, animals, or things. Therefore it includes more than one member.

> My **family** is very big

Collective nouns can refer to:

- **people** -- family, class, committee, staff etc.

- **animals** -- a pack of dogs, a swarm of flies, a herd of horses, a litter of puppies etc.

- **things** -- pack, set, bunch, stack etc.

When the members within one group behave in the same manner, they are part of a collective noun, thus this noun becomes singular and requires a singular verb.

> Every day **the football team** follows its coach out to the field for practice.

When the members are acting as individuals, the collective noun is plural and requires a plural verb. In many cases, it may sound more natural to make the subject plural in form by adding words like _members_, _mates_ etc.

> After the practice, **the team(mates)** shower, change into their casual clothes, and head to their homes.
