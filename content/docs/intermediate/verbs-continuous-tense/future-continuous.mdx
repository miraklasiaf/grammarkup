We use the future continuous to say that we will be in the middle of doing something at certain time in the future. We often use it when we compare what we are doing now with that we will be doing in the future. There is nearly always a time expression.

> The movie starts 8.00 and ends at 10.00. At 9.00 I will be watching the movie

The future continuous is formed with `will` + `be` + the `-ing` form of the verb. Questions are formed by inverting the subject and `will`. Negatives are formed with `will not` (`won't`) + `be` + the `-ing` form of the verb. Contracted forms are used in speech and informal writing.

> (+) Sarah will be flying home at 5 o'clock tomorrow  
> (-) Sarah will not be flying home at 5 o'clock tomorrow./She won't be flying home at 5 o'clock tomorrow  
> (?) Will Sarah be flying home at 5 o'clock tomorrow?/Where will she be flying at 5 o'clock tomorrow?

Some time markers can show that we will be in the middle of doing something at a certain time in the future. These time markers are `at 5 o'clock`, `at that time tomorrow`, `this evening`, `in five years' time` etc.

> Where will you be living in **3 years' time**?

We also use the future continuous to say that something will definitely happen in the future.

> I'll **be going** to the shop later. Can I get you anything?

Compare `will be doing` with the other continuous forms.

> Jane has an ordinary 9/5 job  
> At 11 o'clock yesterday she was working (past continuous)  
> At 11 o'clock today she is working (present continuous)  
> **At 11 o'clock tomorrow she will be working** (future continuous)
