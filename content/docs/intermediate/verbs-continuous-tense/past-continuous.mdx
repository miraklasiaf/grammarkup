---

We use the past continuous when we describe a situation, or several situations in progress, happening at the same time in the past. This is often contrasted with a sudden event in the past simple.

> I **was working** on my computer and my brother **was reading** a book <Tooltip content="background situation" /> when we heard a loud bang on the door <Tooltip content="Sudden event" />

The past continuous is formed with **the past form of the auxiliary verb to be** and **the -ing form of the main verb**. Questions are formed by inverting the subject and the auxiliary verb `to be`. Negatives are formed with the auxiliary verb `to be` + `not`. This is contracted in speech and informal writing.

> (+) Jim **was playing** video games all night  
> (-) Jim **was not playing** video games all night./He **wasn't playing** video games all night  
> (?) **Was Jim **playing video games all night? **Why was** he **playing** video games all night?

Some time markers can emphasize the duration of the action or state when the action was taking place. These time markers are `at 7 o'clock`, `for two hours`, `in January`, `last week`, `all night` etc.

> Kate was trying to find a nice apartment in her area **for 5 months**

We can use `when` or `while` with the past continuous to mean "during the time that".

> **While** they were waiting for the train, it started to rain  
>  James broke his finger **when** he was playing basketball

Remember that **non-continuous verbs** (e.g to love, hate, know, want etc.) are not used in any continuous tenses. Use the past simple instead.

> ~~I was having fun at the party, but Kim was wanting to go home~~. I was having fun at the party, but **Kim wanted to go home**
