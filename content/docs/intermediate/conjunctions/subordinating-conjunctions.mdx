Subordinating conjunctions link two clauses, a main (independent) one and a subordinate (dependent) one.

> **Although** Emma wanted to go together with them, she declined the invitation.

The most commonly used subordinating conjunctions are `although`, `as`, `because`, `if`, `since`, `though`, `unless`, `while`, `whereas` etc.

Subordinating conjunctions perform two functions in a sentence: they state the importance of the independent clause and provide a transition between two ideas within a sentence.

> **Once** she stopped caring about stranger's opinions <Tooltip content="subordinate clause" />, Liz became happier <Tooltip content="main clause" />.

If the subordinate clause follows the main one, we do not usually use a comma.

> My mom cries <Tooltip content="main clause" /> **whenever** she watches a romatic comedy <Tooltip content="subordinate clause" />

If the subordinate clause precedes the main one, use a comma to separate the clauses.

> **After** he had completed his studies <Tooltip content="subordinate clause" />, George decided to travel for a year <Tooltip content="main clause" />.

## Short Story using Subordinating Conjunctions

–_**Whenever** my mom doesn't let my little brother eat candies before dinner, he throws a tantrum!_

–_That sounds awful!_

–_Yeah, we don't know what to do about it. **Even though** we try to be calm **and** explain **that** you can have some candy after eating properly, he becomes all whiny._

–_Maybe he doesn't like something particular? I remember **that** I hated broccoli **when** I was a kid, **and yet** I was always forced to eat it._

–_Hmm, you have a good point._
