title: Compound Conjunctions
description: Correlative conjunctions connect two equal grammatical items in a sentence.
---

Compound conjunctions are phrases which are used as conjunctions. A compound conjunction has two or three words that go together - `so that`, `as long as`, `even though` etc.

> You can buy whatever you want **as long as** you use your own money

Even though compound conjunctions have two or three words that go together, they are different from correlative conjunctions which are conjunctions used only in pairs. Compare the sentences:

> Beth likes painting **as well as** drawing  
> Beth thinks that you can be good **either** at painting **or** at drawing

They are several commonly used compound conjunctions:

> You can buy clothes **as well as** shoes there (You can buy clothes and shoes there)  
> **As soon as** it started raining, they opened the windows in the apartment (It started raining and they immediately opened the windows)  
> The kid sang so loudly **as if**/**as though** there was no one in the room (The kids sang so loudly like there was no one in the room)  
> **Even if**/**Even though** I don't like plain honey, I'll eat sweets with honey in them (I don't like plain honey but nevertheless I'll eat sweets with hone in them)  
> John will pass the test **provided that** he studies every day (If John studies every day, he'll pass the test)  
> I'll turn off my phone **so that** no one disturbs me  
> Please turn off your phones **in order that** we are not disturbed by anyone (**in order that** is more formal than **so that**)
