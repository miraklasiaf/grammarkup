title: Will - Would
description: We use modal verbs to show if we believe something is certain, probable or possible (or not). We also use modals to ask permission, make requests and offers etc.
---

We normally use _will_ to speak about the future, though it is also classified as a modal verb. We use the modal verb `will` and `base form of the verb` to form sentences. Questions are formed by inverting the subject and _will_. Negatives are formed with _not_. Contracted forms are used (`won't`).

We can use the modal verb `will`:

- **to express rapid decision**.

> Which one? - Hmm, I **will** have the tuna sandwich

- **to express thoughts or beliefs about the future**.

> I think they **will** remain friends forever

- **to make an offer, a promise, or a threat**.

> I **will not** disappoint you!

- **to talk about predictable behaviour**.

> He **will** eat chocolate when he feels anxious

Note that we use `won't` when someone refuses to do something.

> I tried reassuring him, but he **won't** listen to me

We use the modal verb `would` and `the base form of the verb` to form sentences. Questions are formed by inverting the subject and `would`. Negatives are formed with _not_.

We can use the modal verb `would`:

- **as a polite invitation or to offer**

> **Would** you like to spend this evening together with me?

- **to describe a prediction**

> It **would** be nice to be a little bit funnier

- **not to sound impolite when disagreeing with someone**

> I **wouldn't** put it like that

- **to describe past habits**

> She **would** fall asleep when she was on a train.

Note that we use `wouldn't` when someone refused to do something.

> James said that he **wouldn't** help us at all
