Superlative adjectives are used to describe an object which is at the upper or lower limit of a quality (_the tallest_, _the smallest_ etc.). They are used in sentences where a subject is compared to a group objects.

When forming the superlative degree follow the pattern _**noun**/**pronoun** (subject) + **verb** + **the** + **superlative adjective** + **noun**/**pronoun** (object)._

> My room is **the largest** one in the house

The group that is being compared with can be omitted if it is clear from the context that something is at the upper or lower limit of a quality.

> She is **the prettiest** (girl in the office.)

Superlative adjectives with one syllable are normally formed by adding `-est` to the adjective.

> smart - the smart**est**

if an adjective has a _consonant_ + _single vowel_ + _consonant_ spelling, the final consonant must be _doubled_ before adding `-est`.

> big - the big**gest**

Adjectives ending in _consonant_ + _-y_ change _-y_ to _-i_ and add _-est_,

> dry - the dr**iest**

Adjectives with two syllables can form the superlative either by adding `-est` or by preceding the adjective with `the most`.

> happy - the happ**iest**  
> tangled - **the most** tangled

In many cases, both forms are used, although one usage will be more common than the other. If you are not sure whether a two-syllable adjective can take a superlative ending, use `the most` instead.

Adjectives with three or more syllables form the superlative by preceding the adjective with `the most`.

> beautiful - **the most** beautiful

Some adjectives do not follow any of the rules explained earlier. They are compared irregularly. Here are the most common irregular adjectives.

| Positive    | Comparative       | Superlative             |
| :---------- | :---------------- | ----------------------- |
| _good_      | _better_          | _the best_              |
| _bad_       | _worse_           | _the worst_             |
| _far_       | _farther/further_ | _the farthest/furthest_ |
| _little_    | _less_            | _the least_             |
| _much/many_ | _more_            | _the most_              |

## Guided Practice

<Sidenote mt={8}>
  When forming the superlative degree follow the pattern _noun/pronoun (Subject) + verb + the +
  superlative adjective + than + noun/pronoun (object)_
</Sidenote>

- Adam is (tall) <Blank /> boy in class. <InfoTooltip label="the tallest" />

<Sidenote>
  {`
  - vowel + cons → double cons + -est
  - cons + -y → const + -i + -est
  - two syllables + -est OR the most
  - three syllables + the most`}
</Sidenote>

- heavy → <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="the heaviest" />
- fat → <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="the fattest" />
- hot → <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="the hottest" />
- easy → <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="the easiest" />
- wealthy → <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="the wealthiest / the most wealthy" />
- important → <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="the most important" />
- difficult → <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="the most difficult" />
