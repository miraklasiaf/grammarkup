Most adverbs can show degree of quality or quantity by forming two degrees of comparison: the comparative degree and the superlative degree. These degrees are formed from the positive degree, which is the usual form of adverbs.

|      Positive      |            Comparative             |              Superlative              |
| :----------------: | :--------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------: |
| _She eats slowly._ | _She eats more slowly than we do._ | _She eats the most slowly of us all._ |

The comparative form is used for comparing two actions or states, while the superlative is used for comparing one action or state with all the others in the same category.

> He runs **faster** than jack does. But we need to check for sure who runs **the fastest**.

There are three ways in which the comparatives and the superlatives are formed, depending on the spelling of the base adverbs.

If an adverb ends in `-ly`, add `more` to make the comparative, and `the most` to make the superlative.

> happily - **more** happily - **the most** happily

If an adverb has the same form as an adjective, follow the same rules when you form the comparative or superlative degree of adjectives, i.e. by adding the endings `-er` or `-est`. If an adverb ends in `-y`, then you change the `y` to `-i` before adding `-er` or `-est`. If an adverb has one syllable and ends in `-e`, simply add `-r` or `-st`.

> late - later - the latest

Some adverbs do not follow any of the rules explained earlier. They are irregular. Here are the most common irregular adverbs.

| Positive |    Comparative    |         Superlative         |
| :------: | :---------------: | :-------------------------: |
|  _well_  |     _better_      |         _the best_          |
| _badly_  |      _worse_      |         _the worst_         |
|  _much_  |      _more_       |         _the most_          |
| _little_ |      _less_       |         _the least_         |
|  _far_   | _farther/further_ | _the farthest/the furthest_ |

Note that it impossible to have comparatives or superlatives of certain adverbs, especially those of **time** (e.g. _daily_, _yesterday_, _then_), **place** (e.g. _there_, _up_, _down_), and **degree** (e.g. _very_, _just_, _too_).

## Guided Practice

<Sidenote mt={8}>
  Comparative adverbs are used to compare differences between the two objects they modify.
  Superlative adverbs are used for comparing one action or state with all the others in the same
  category. Spot these adverbs.
</Sidenote>

- This car is better than that one. I want to see which one is the best. <InfoTooltip label="better than, the best" />

**Form the comparatives and the superlatives.**

- quietly - <Blank /> - <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="more quietly, the most quietly " />
- low - <Blank /> - <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="lower, the lowest" />
- near - <Blank /> - <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="nearer, the nearest" />
- seriously - <Blank /> - <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="more seriously, the most seriously" />

**Form the comparative and the superlative degrees of the adverb _badly_.**

- She performs <Blank /> yesterday. Has anything happened? <InfoTooltip label="worse than" />
- She performed <Blank /> of any actor today. <InfoTooltip label="the best" />

<Sidenote>
  Note that it impossible to have comparatives or superlatives of certain adverbs, especially those
  of **time** (e.g. _daily_, _yesterday_, _then_), **place** (e.g. _there_, _up_, _down_), and
  **degree** (e.g. _very_, _just_, _too_).

- ~~He cooks more daily than his sister.~~ <InfoTooltip label="He cooks daily while his sister rarely cooks." />

## Short Story using Comparative and Superlative Adverbs

窶点I haven't thought that Paul can play basketball **that well**!_

窶点Actually, he was in the basketball club at school, so back then he played **even better**. Honestly, I think he played **the best** of any teammates._

窶点Yeah? I didn't know that._

窶点Yeah, but after the knee injury he started to play **less** and **less**. Sadly, that was inevitable._

## Independent Practice

**Form the comparatives and the superlatives.**

| Positive | Comparative | Superlative |                                                      |
| :------: | :---------: | :---------: | :--------------------------------------------------- |
|  _very_  |  <Blank />  |  <Blank />  | <InfoTooltip label="-, -" />                         |
|  _well_  |  <Blank />  |  <Blank />  | <InfoTooltip label="better, the best" />             |
|  _long_  |  <Blank />  |  <Blank />  | <InfoTooltip label="longer, the longest" />          |
| _loudly_ |  <Blank />  |  <Blank />  | <InfoTooltip label="more loudly, the most loudly" /> |
| _badly_  |  <Blank />  |  <Blank />  | <InfoTooltip label="worse, the worst" />             |

**Spot the mistakes in the following sentences. Correct them.**

1. Susan came to work very lately yesterday. <InfoTooltip label="Susan came to work very late yesterday." />
2. You should speak more quitlier at the library! <InfoTooltip label="You should speak more quietly at the library!" />
3. We ran quite farly that day. <InfoTooltip label="We ran quite far that day." />
