We use the present perfect continuous when we talk about an action (quite a long one) which began in the past and has recently or just stopped.

This tense usually emphasizes:

- duration of the action
- that the action is temporary
- that the action is repeated

> Is it snowing right now? - No, it isn't but there is 5 cm of snow outside. **It has been snowing all night**

The present perfect continuous is formed using `has`/`have` + `been` + `present participle`. Questions are indicated by inverting the subject and `has`/`have`. Negatives are made with `not`.

> (+) Ann **has been waiting** for Sam for over an hour  
> (-) Ann **hasn't been waiting** for Sam for over an hour. She **has been waiting** for only 10 minutes  
> (?) **Has Ann been waiting** for Sam for over an hour? / **How long has Ann been** waiting for Sam?

Some time markers can emphasizes the duration of the action, show that the action is temporary or repeated. These time markers are `all day`, `all morning`, `for days`, `for ages`, `lately`, `recently`, `since`, `for` etc.

> My brother has been playing tennis **since** he was seven  
> I haven't been feeling well **recently**  
> How long have you been learning English? - I've been learning it **for 5 years**

Remember that **non-continuous verbs** (_e.g. to love, hate, know, want etc._) **are not used** in any continuous tenses. Use the present perfect instead.

> ~~I've been wanting to visit Paris for years~~. I'**ve wanted** to visit Paris for years
