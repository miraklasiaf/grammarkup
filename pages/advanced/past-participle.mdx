---

A past participle refers to the form of a verb which is used in forming perfect and passive tenses (and sometimes used as an adjective).

> Olivia has **lived** in Greece for 4 years

We usually add `-ed` to the base form of the regular verb to form the past participle.

> Jun has just **painted** this picture (present perfect, active voice)  
> This picture was **painted** by Jun a month ago (past simple, passive voice)

There is no pattern as to forming the past participle of the irregular verbs. You should always consult a dictionary.

We can use the past participle:

- **in perfect tenses** (Present Perfect, Past Perfect, Future Perfect)

> I've **eaten** too much! I can't move (present perfect)  
> James had already **left** when Pam arrived (past perfect)  
> We will have **landed** by that hour (future perfect)

- **in the passive voice**

> He was **driven** by genuine interest and curiosity  
> This dress was **made** by a famous Italian designer

- **as an adjective**. In this case, place it before a noun

> Mike has **broken** his arm → He has a **broken** arm now  
> Someone has stolen Ann's purse → Her purse was **stolen**

## Guided Practice

**Decide whether the past participle indicated the perfect tense, passive voice, or adjective.**

- The **stolen** phone was **found** near the train station. <InfoTooltip label="adjective, passive voice" />
- I'm sure that it'll have been **sold** by 10 a.m. <InfoTooltip label="future perfect" />
- It was lear that John has never **heard** of vegemite. <InfoTooltip label="present perfect" />

**Fill in the gaps with the past participle.**

- I don't think that Mrs. Taylor has ever (to cry) <Blank /> . She definitely has a strong character. <InfoTooltip label="cried" />
- Do you remember what was (to write) <Blank /> on the shopping list? I forgot it at home. <InfoTooltip label="written" />
- Don't worry that much. You'll probably find it in the (to lose) <Blank /> and (to find) <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="lost, found" />
