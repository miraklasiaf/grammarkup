Predeterminers are words placed before determiners in a sentence, i.e. they modify the determiner.

> **What** a great day!

Predeterminers are usually placed before an `indefinite article` + `adjective` + `noun` to express an opinion about the noun they modify.

Predeterminers can be classified into the following categories:

- **multipliers (twice, three times)** -- are used to express more than the specified amount.

> My brothers makes **twice** my annual salary  
> I try to call my parents at least **three times** a week

- **fractions (half, one-eighth)** -- are used to express a fraction of an amount.

> The bus will arrive in **half** an hour. We've got plenty of time  
> I ate **one-third** of the pizza we cooked last night

- **intensifiers (such, what, quite, rather)** -- are used to express surprise, disappointment, pleasure, or other emotions.

`Such` and `what` are used to express surprise or other emotions.

> Alice is **such** a kind person!  
> **What** a fantastic meal it is!

`Quite` and `rather` refer to the degree of a particular quality as expressed by the adjective that modfies the noun. They can express disappointment, pleasure, or other emotions depending on the adjective.

Note that in British English, `rather` is used as a predeterminer, while in American English it is only used as an adverb.

> Actually, it was **quite** a nice meal. I am surprised  
> He's always been **rather** a difficult child (BrE)

- other pre-determiners such as `all`, `both` do not fall into the other groups. They are used to express the entire amount.

> Jake broke **both** his legs when hiking  
> How did you manage to real **all** these books in one week?

## Guided Practice

<Sidenote mt={8}>
  Use multipliers (twice, three times) to express more than the specified amount.
</Sidenote>

- `Their meals`/`twice`/`the size of ours`/`to be`. <InfoTooltip label="Their meals are twice the size of ours" />

<Sidenote>Use fractions (half, one-eighth) to express a fraction of an amount.</Sidenote>

- `Kim`/`a bottle of`/`to drink`/`wine`/`half`/`yesterday`. <InfoTooltip label="Kim drank half a bottle of wine yesterday" />

<Sidenote>Use intensifiers (such, what) to express surprise or other emotions.</Sidenote>

- It was <Blank /> a crazy adventure! <InfoTooltip label="such" />
- <Blank /> a delightful evening! <InfoTooltip label="What" />

<Sidenote>Use intensifiers (quite, rather) to express surprise or other emotions.</Sidenote>

- The food there is usually <Blank /> good. <InfoTooltip label="quite" />
- It was <Blank /> dull in there, so I decided to head home. <InfoTooltip label="rather" />

<Sidenote>Use other predeterminers such as _all, both_ to express the entire amount.</Sidenote>

- <Blank /> my friends threw a surprise b-day party for me! <InfoTooltip label="All" />

## Short Story using Predeterminers

–_Let me tell you about our trip to Germany. You know that I'm **quite** good at German but I felt **rather** hopeless at first - I couldn't understand anyone! Certainly it did not help that we were in Bavaria._

–_Yeah, I've heard stories about the accent there! **What** a challenge!_

–_And I would ask someone **three times** before understanding what they said. I felt **quite** stupid but it got better with time. **All** people were very kind to us. In the end we even managed to make friends with Adam and Martha from there. They are **such** a nice couple!_
