An adverb is a word or set of words that modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Usually adverbs modify verbs, telling us how, how often, when, or where something was done.

> We walked **really slowly**

<Sidenote>
  There are two adverbs in the sentence, _really_ and _slowly_. The adverb _slowly_ modifies the
  verb walked, telling us how we walked. And the adverb _really_ modifies the other adverb, slowly.
  And it tells us how slowly we walked.
</Sidenote>

As adverbs are used to modify verbs, adjectives, other adverbs, phrases, clauses, or even entire sentences, they are able to function nearly anywhere in the sentence, depending on their type and what it is they are modifying.

If we use more than one adverb to describe a verb, there is a general order in which the different categories of adverbs should appear (sometimes called the royal order of adverbs):

1. manner
2. place
3. frequency
4. time
5. purpose

It is uncommon to use five adverbs in a row to modify the same word, but if a sentence uses two or more, then it is best to follow this order to avoid sounding unnatural.

Adverbs of manner tell us how something happens, how someone does something, or give character to a description.

> Alice sings **beautifully**

Adverbs of place tell us about an aspect of location associated with the action of a verb, specifying the direction, distance, movement, or position involved in the action.

> We looked **upwards** at the fireworks

Adverbs of frequency tell us how often something happens.

> Peter goes abroad **twice a year**

Adverbs of time tell us when or for how long something happens or is the case.

> They've been dating **for 4 years**

Adverbs of purpose tell us why something happens.

> The dress is handcrafted and **hence** expensive

Adverbs indicating the attitude and point of view of the speaker or writer usually go at the beginning.

> **Actually**, I don't want to go there
