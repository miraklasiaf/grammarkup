Conditionals type 1 or first conditionals are used to describe future events that will happen or are likely to happen. These sentences are based on facts, thus we make statements about the real world or particular situation.

> **If** you don't study, you will fail the exam. (Sometimes you can pass an exam without studying, but this time it won't work)

Use the present simple tense in the `if` clause and the future simple tense in the main clause. Note that the order of the main and `if` clauses is not fixed. Although when the `if` clause precedes the main one, use a comma.

|         IF clause (If + present simple)          | MAIN clause (future simple) |
| :----------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------: |
|          _**If** the weather is great,_          |   _we'll go to the park_    |
| _**If** you don't stop fighting with each other_ | _you two will be grounded!_ |

Note that it is possible to use other present tenses (e.g. present continuous, present perfect) in the `if` clause.

> If **you're going**, I'll go too! (if + present continuous, future simple)  
> If **they've already received** you information, they will let you know. (if + present perfect, future simple)

First conditionals can be used to give instructions in some particular situation.

> **If** you carry all these bottles at once, you'll drop them. It's too dangerous!

## Guided Practice

<Sidenote mt={8}>
  Zero conditionals are used to describe things that are always or generally true. First
  conditionals are used to describe future events that will happen or are likely to happen. Mark
  zero conditionals as ZC and first conditionals as FC>
</Sidenote>

- If there is milk left in the fridge, I'll bake some pancakes. (<Blank />). <InfoTooltip label="FC" />
- If people feel sleepy, they go to bed or drink coffee. (<Blank />). <InfoTooltip label="ZC" />
- What will we do if they notice us? (<Blank />). <InfoTooltip label="FC" />

**Use the present simple tense in the _if_ clause and the future simple tense in the main clause.**

`if` - `anyone` - `to break in` - `the police` - `to be` - `here` - `in 5 minutes`. <InfoTooltip label="If anyone breaks in, the police will be here in 5 minutes" />

`I` - `to stop by` - `if` - `I` - `to get off from work` - `earlier` - `today`. <InfoTooltip label="I'll stop by if I get off from work earlier today" />

## Short Story using Conditionals Type 1

–_My parents are just too much sometimes! They constantly tell me that **if** I don't study, I won't pass the exams. **If** I don't eat healthy, I'll have health problems later in life. **If** don't go out more, I won't have friends._

–_Gosh, that's depressing! I can see where they're coming from though. They're just worried, I suppose._

–_It'd be better if they were less straightforward._
