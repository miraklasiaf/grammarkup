Conditionals type 3 or third conditionals are used to describe a past event that is different to what really happened. These sentences are solely hypothetical, thus there is always some implication of regret.

> **If** we hadn't booked this trip, we wouldn't have missed her graduation ceremony. (We wanted to be at her graduation ceremony but we missed it because we were on a trip somewhere else.)

Use the past perfect tense in the _if_ clause and `would have + the past participle` in the main clause. Note that the order of the main and _if_ clauses are not fixed. Although when the _if_ clause precedes the main one, use a comma.

|        IF clause (If + past perfect)        | MAIN clause (would have + Ved/past participle) |
| :-----------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------: |
| _**If** we had bought that lottery ticket,_ |              _we would have won._              |
|   _**If** Jake hadn't drunk that night,_    |    _he wouldn't got into the car accident._    |

Note that both `would` and `had` can be contracted to _`d_. Remember that `would` never appears in the _if_ clause.

> **If** I **had** known that, I **would** have warned you = **If** I'**d** known that, I'**d** have warned you

## Guided Practice

<Sidenote mt={8}>
  Third conditionals are used to describe a past event that is different to what really happened.
  Mark second conditionals as SC and third conditionals as TC.
</Sidenote>

- If I'd known, I wouldn't have do it. (<Blank />). <InfoTooltip label="TC" />
- They wouldn't have missed the bus if they had left earlier. (<Blank />). <InfoTooltip label="TC" />
- If Sam had more free time, he would be happier. (<Blank />). <InfoTooltip label="SC" />

<Sidenote>
  Third conditionals are solely hypothetical, thus there is always some implication of regret.
  Rewrite the sentences so that their meanings stays the same.
</Sidenote>

I could call Kelly that time. I know that she would help me. <InfoTooltip label="If I'd called Kelly, she would have helped me." />

I really wanted to go to the party but I had too much homework. <InfoTooltip label="If I'd finished my homework, I would have gone to the party" />

## Short Story using Conditionals Type 3

–_Would you have come to my party **if** you had known that Meredith was there?_

–_I definitely wouldn't have come to your party **if** I had known she was there. I'm glad that I saw her standing somewhere in the crowd right when I entered your place and had a chance to avoid the greeting part._

–_**If** I had known that you two weren't on good terms, I wouldn't have invited her._

-_It's already in the past. Don't worry about it._

## Independent Practice

**Match the sentences.**

|                                               |                                                               |                                |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------- |
| a. If Emma would have been more attentive,    | 1. we wouldn't have been lost.                                | <InfoTooltip label="(a, 5)" /> |
| b. If there had been Wi-Fi,                   | 2. I wouldn't have been staying up late working on my thesis. | <InfoTooltip label="(b, 1)" /> |
| c. Erick would have lost the fight            | 3. we would have won the cup.                                 | <InfoTooltip label="(c, 7)" /> |
| d. If I had been better at time management,   | 4. you would have known the news.                             | <InfoTooltip label="(d, 2)" /> |
| e. If Pam had written a shopping list,        | 5. she wouldn't have failed the class.                        | <InfoTooltip label="(e, 6)" /> |
| f. If you had called me last week,            | 6. she wouldn't have forgotten to buy tea.                    | <InfoTooltip label="(f, 4)" /> |
| g. If your team would have scored more goals, | 7. if he hadn't worked out every single day.                  | <InfoTooltip label="(g, 3)" /> |

**Write three sentences with third conditionals.**

1. <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="If you hadn't woken me up, I would have been late." />

2. <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="If we had arrived earlier, we wouldn't have missed the plane" />

3. <Blank /> <InfoTooltip label="If Susan hadn't drunk last night, she wouldn't have been hungover." />
