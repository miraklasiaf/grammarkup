Conjunctions are words that link other words, phrases, clauses, or sentences together.

> _Susan is an amazing wife **and** a wonderful mom._

Conjunctions add eloquence to our speech. They also allow us to form complex sentences instead of using multiple short ones.

> - _Bran likes eating. He doesn't like cooking. He finds cooking boring._
> - _Bran likes eating **but** he doesn't like cooking **as** he finds it boring._

Conjunctions can be divided into the following categories:

- **subordinating conjunctions** -- link two clauses, a main (independent) one and a subordinate (dependent) one. The most commonly used subordinating conjunctions are `although`, `as`, `because`, `if`, `though`, `unless`, etc.

> _She won't speak with her parents **unless** they apoligise first._

- **correlative conjunctions** -- connect two equal grammatical items. These conjunctions come in pairs - `either ... or`, `neither ... nor`, `not only ... but also`.

> _**Either** we go to the party **or** we stay at home._

- **compound conjunctions** -- are phrases which are used as conjunctions. A compound conjunction has two or three words that go together - `so that`, `as long as`, `even though`, etc.

> _Mike lied to his parents **so that** he could go to the party._

- **coordinating conjunctions** -- are used to link words, phrases, and clauses of equal importance in a sentence. There are seven coordinating conjunctions - `for`, `and`, `nor`, `but`, `or`, `yet`, `so`.

> _Beth doesn't like cheese, **yet** she eats pizza nearly every day._

## Guided Practice

**Subordinating conjunctions link two clauses, a main one and a subordinate one. Choose the correct ones.**

- _Yet_/_if_ it is raining outside, take an umbrella _so that_/_unless_ you want to get wet. <InfoTooltip label="if, unless" />

**Correlative conjunctions connect two equal grammatical items. Choose the correct ones.**

- _Either_/_Neither_ did they message her afterwards, _or_/_nor_ did they invite her over again. <InfoTooltip label="Neither, nor" />

**Coordinating conjunctions are used to link words, phrases, and clauses of equal importance in a sentence. Choose the correct ones.**

- You claim to be allergic to dairy, _yet_/_or_ you eat cheese _for_/_and_ butter. <InfoTooltip label="yet, and" />

## Short Story using Conjunctions

-_I heard **that** Erick is moving to a new place. Is it true?_

-_Yeah, he is moving to a bigger apartment with his girlfriend. **Even though** they haven't been dating for that long, they decided to live together to save some money._

-_Yeah, it actually makes sense **as** rent is so expensive right now!_

-_Totally! **And as long as** they get along, I don't see a problem with them living together so soon._

## Independent Practice

**Spot conjunctions in the following text.**

The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.

...

As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.
