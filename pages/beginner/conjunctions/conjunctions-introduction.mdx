Conjunctions are words that link other words, phrases, clauses, or sentences together.

> Susan is an amazing wife **and** a wonderful mom

Conjunctions add eloquence to our speech. They also allow us to form complex sentences instead of using multiple short ones.

> Bran likes eating. He doesn't like cooking. He finds cooking boring  
> Bran likes eating **but** he doesn't like cooking **as** he finds it boring

Conjunctions can be divided into the following categories:

- **subordinating conjunctions** -- link two clauses, a main (independent) one and a subordinate (dependent) one. The most commonly used subordinating conjunctions are `although`, `as`, `because`, `if`, `though`, `unless`, etc.

> She won't speak with her parents **unless** they apologise first

- **correlative conjunctions** -- connect two equal grammatical items. These conjunctions come in pairs - `either ... or`, `neither ... nor`, `not only ... but also`.

> **Either** we go to the party **or** we stay at home

- **compound conjunctions** -- are phrases which are used as conjunctions. A compound conjunction has two or three words that go together - `so that`, `as long as`, `even though`, etc.

> Mike lied to his parents **so that** he could go to the party

- **coordinating conjunctions** -- are used to link words, phrases, and clauses of equal importance in a sentence. There are seven coordinating conjunctions - `for`, `and`, `nor`, `but`, `or`, `yet`, `so`.

> Beth doesn't like cheese, **yet** she eats pizza nearly every day

## Short Story using Conjunctions

-_Totally! **And as long as** they get along, I don't see a problem with them living together so soon._

## Independent Practice

**Spot conjunctions in the following text.**

The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.

...

As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.
