We use modal verbs to show if we believe something is certain, probable or possible (or not). We use
modals to ask permission, make request and offers etc.

Modal verbs fall into the category of auxiliary verbs. It means that they are used together with a
main verb to give grammatical information and additional meaning to a sentence.

The modal verb `can` has only two forms: `can` (_present_) and `could` (past). We use the modal verb
`can` and `the base form of the verb` to form sentences. Questions are formed by inverting the
subject and `can`. Negatives are formed with `not`. Contracted forms are used (`can't`/`couldn't`).

We can use the modal:

1. **Can**

- to talk about general abilities or skill in the present.

> _I **can** cook and bake._

- to make general statements about what is possible/impossible (not allowed)

> - _It **can** be very hot in summer._
> - _You **can't** smoke here._

- to ask permission (informal)

> _**Can** I borrow your pencil, please?_

- to request something (informal)

> _**Can** you help me, please?_

- to make offers

> _**Can** I carry these bags for you?_

2. **Could**

- to talk about general abilities or skill in the past.

> _I **could** paint beautifully as a kid _

- to make general statements about what was possible/impossible (not allowed)

> - _It **could** be very hot in summer._
> - _He **couldn't** do it! He is such a sweet guy._

- to ask permission (formal)

> _**Could** I use your phone, please? _

- to request something (formal)

> _**Could** you show me the way, please?_

- to make suggestion

> _We **could** go to the bar if you want._
