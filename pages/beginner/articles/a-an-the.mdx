Articles are words that define a noun as specific or unspecific. English has two types of articles:

- **indefinite**: _a/an_
- **definite**: _the_

> _I'am **a** nurse. **The** hospital I'm working in is huge._

The indefinite article takes two forms - `a`/`an`. Use the indefinite article `a` when it precedes a word that begins with a consonant. Use the indefinite article `an` when it precedes a word that begins with a vowel. For example:

- a table
- an umbrella
- a university
- an honest person

The indefinite article `a` indicates that a noun refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing.

> _What does **a** fox say? _

We use `a`/`an` when the listener does not know which person or thing we are talking about.

> _Helen's brother works in **a** factory. I don't know which factory exactly_

If we refer to something for the first time, it will be new information for the listener so we use `a`/`an`. When referencing to the same thing again use `the` because now the listener knows what we are talking about.

> _I bought **a** new computer. It's really great! **The** computer is much better than my previous one._

The definite article is the word `the`. It limits the meaning of a noun to one particular thing. We use `the` when it is clear which thing or person we are talking about.

> _**The** cake is in the fridge. I know that Kate made it._

We use the definite article `the` with:

- **nationalities and other groups** -- the French, the Italians, the old, the poor
- **time** -- in the past, in the future (but at present)
- **superlatives** -- You are the first one!
- **musical instruments** -- I played the piano as a kid
- **countries which are group or plural** -- the U.S., the U.K., the United Arab Emirates, the Netherlands
- **names of ships** -- We sailed on the Claudia
- **oceans** -- the Pacific, the Atlantic
- **rivers** -- the Amazon, the Nile

**Note**: we use zero article with plurals and uncountable nouns when we are generally talking about something.

> - _**Dogs** are not allowed in that shop_. (We are talking about dogs in general)
> - _**The dogs** next door were barking at night._ (We are talking about the particular dogs)

## Guided Practice

**Use the indefinite article _a_ when it precedes a word that begins with a consonant. Use the indefinite article _an_ when it precedes a word that begins with a vowel.**

- .................... apple. <InfoTooltip label="an" />
- .................... European country. <InfoTooltip label="a" />
- .................... talented actor. <InfoTooltip label="a" />
- .................... union. <InfoTooltip label="an" />
- .................... monk. <InfoTooltip label="a" />

**The indefinite article _a_ indicates that a noun refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing**

- Should I get her .................... gift? I've just met her. <InfoTooltip label="a" />

**If we refer to something for the first time, it will be new information for the listener so we use _a/an_. When referencing to the same thing again use _the_ because now the listener knows what we are talking about.**

- Well, I bought .................... <InfoTooltip label="a" /> dress for the upcoming party. I'll go to a spa, get a hair-do, and I'll look amazing in .................... <InfoTooltip label="the" /> dress.

**We use the definite article _the_ with nationalities and other groups, time, superlatives, musical instruments, countries which are a group or plural, names of ships, oceans, and rivers.**

- the Russians, the British, the sick, the educated
- in the near future (but _at present_)
- the best performance
- to play the flute
- the U.K., the Netherlands
- to sail on the Mary
- the Indian ocean
- the Thames

**We use zero article with plurals and uncountable nouns when we are generally talking about something.**

- **Fruit and vegetables** are food for your health

## Short Story using Articles

-_Liz, can I get you anything?_

-_**A cup of coffee** would be nice. I feel extremely exhausted. I haven't thought that flying over **the Atlantic** would be **the worst trip** I've ever taken. And you know that I hate **train rides the most**!_

-_Well, the flight was delayed too so you were stuck **at the airport for a longer period of time**._

-_I am just hoping that **in the near future** we'll build **a teleport**. Then travelling from **the U.S. to the Netherlands** won't take that long!_

-_I wish it were like that! Here is **your coffee**._

-_Thank you!_
