A subject is **the person or thing that performs the action** in the clause or sentence. A subject pronoun is a pronoun that takes the place of a noun as the subject of a sentence. For example:

> _**She** told me about her worries_

Subject pronouns replace nouns that are the subject of their clause. Look the following table:

|            |  Singular   | Plural |
| :--------: | :---------: | :----: |
| 1st person |     _I_     |  _we_  |
| 2nd person |    _you_    | _you_  |
| 3rd person | _he/she/it_ | _they_ |

We should replace the subject with a subject pronoun to avoid repetition.

> _~~Mary is a student and Mary is very hard working~~_. _Mary is a student and she is very hard working_

We use the subject pronoun `it` when we refer to objects, things, animals, or ideas.

> _Love is eternal. **It** will last forever_

Sometimes when we don't know the sex of a baby, we can use `it`.

> _Their baby is so small. **it** only weights 2 kilos_

We use _it_ when we talk about time, weather, or temperature.

> _What time is it? - **It's** 7 o'clock_. _It's quite cold today_.
