There are many kinds of adjectives. Among them there is a category of descriptive adjectives. Descriptive adjectives describe nouns or pronouns in detail by giving an attribute to that particular word. They usually express things through the five senses (touch, taste, sight, smell, and sound).

> _This is a **delicious** sandwich._

Descriptive adjectives can be organized into the following categories according to their structure:

- **simple adjectives** are the most basic type of descriptive adjectives. Aspects such as feelings, time, sound, quantity, taste, appearance, size, age, color, shape, and material are expressed through simple adjectives.

> _It was a **beautiful** day yesterday. **Clear** sky, **sweet** smell of blossoming trees, **green** grass, **cheerful** people... It seemed as if the world had united to celebrate the coming of spring._

- **compound adjectives** are created when two words are combined to create a descriptive adjective. The two words are typically connected with a hyphen.

> _Pam was a **baby-faced long-legged** girl._
